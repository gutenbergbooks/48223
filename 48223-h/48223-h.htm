<p class="pn"><span class="beg">Gaming</span> is derived from the Saxon word <i>Gamen</i>, meaning
<i>joy</i>, <i>pleasure</i>, <i>sports</i>, or <i>gaming</i>&mdash;and is so interpreted by
Bailey, in his Dictionary of 1736; whilst Johnson gives
Gamble&mdash;<i>to play extravagantly for money</i>, and this distinction
is to be borne in mind in the perusal of this book;
although the older term was in use until the invention of
the later&mdash;as we see in Cotton’s <i>Compleat Gamester</i> (1674),
in which he gives the following excellent definition of the
word:&mdash;“<i>Gaming</i> is an enchanting <i>witchery</i>, gotten between
<i>Idleness</i> and <i>Avarice</i>: an itching disease, that makes
some scratch the head, whilst others, as if they were bitten
by a <i>Tarantula</i>, are laughing themselves to death; or,
lastly, it is a paralytical distemper, which, seizing the
arm, the man cannot chuse but shake his elbow. It hath
this ill property above all other Vices, that it renders a man
incapable of prosecuting any serious action, and makes
him always unsatisfied with his own condition; he is either
lifted up to the top of mad joy with success, or plung’d to
the bottom of despair by misfortune, always in extreams,
always in a storm; this minute the Gamester’s countenance
is so serene and calm, that one would think nothing could
disturb it, and the next minute, so stormy and tempestuous
that it threatens destruction to itself and others; and, as he
is transported with joy when he wins, so, losing, is he tost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
upon the billows of a high swelling passion, till he hath lost
sight, both of sense and reason.”</p>

<p><i>Gambling</i>, as distinguished from <i>Gaming</i>, or playing, I
take to mean an indulgence in those games, or exercises, in
which <i>chance</i> assumes a more important character; and my
object is to draw attention to the fact, that the <i>money motive</i>
increases, as chance predominates over skill. It is taken up
as a quicker road to wealth than by pursuing honest industry,
and everyone engaged in it, be it dabbling on the Stock
Exchange, Betting on Horse Racing, or otherwise, hopes to
win, for it is clear that if he knew he should lose, no fool
would embark in it. The direct appropriation of other
people’s property to one’s own use, is, undoubtedly, the more
simple, but it has the disadvantage of being both vulgar and
dangerous; so we either appropriate our neighbour’s goods,
or he does ours, by gambling with him, for it is certain that
if one gains, the other loses. The winner is not reverenced,
and the loser is not pitied. But it is a disease that is most
contagious, and if a man is known to have made a lucky <i>coup</i>,
say, on the Stock Exchange, hundreds rush in to follow his example,
as they would were a successful gold field discovered&mdash;the
warning of those that perish by the way is unheeded.</p>

<p>Of the universality of gambling there is no doubt, and it
seems to be inherent in human nature. We can understand
its being introduced from one nation to another&mdash;but, unless
it developed naturally, how can we account for aboriginals,
like the natives of New England, who had never had intercourse
with foreign folk, but whom Governor Winslow<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
describes as being advanced gamblers. “It happened that
two of their men fell out, as they were in game (for they
use gaming as much as anywhere; and will play away all,
even the skin from their backs; yea, and for their wives’
skins also, although they may be many miles distant from
them, as myself have seen), and, growing to great heat, the
one killed the other.”<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>The antiquity of gambling is incontestable, and can be
authentically proved, both by Egyptian paintings, and by
finding the materials in tombs of undoubted genuineness;
and it is even attributed to the gods themselves, as we read
in Plutarch’s Ἰσιδος και Ὀσιριδος “Now the story of Isis and
Osiris, its most insignificant and superfluous parts omitted,
is thus briefly narrated:&mdash;Rhea, they say, having accompanied
with Saturn by stealth, was discovered by the Sun,
who, hereupon, denounced a curse upon her, <i>that she should
not be delivered in any month or year</i>. Mercury, however,
being likewise in love with the same goddess, in recompense
for the favours which he had received from her, <i>plays at
tables</i> with the Moon, and wins from her the seventieth
part of each of her illuminations; these several parts,
making, in the whole, five new days, he afterwards joined
together, and added to the three hundred and sixty, of
which the year formerly consisted: which days are even
yet called by the Egyptians, the <i>Epact</i>, or <i>Superadded</i>, and
observed by them as the birth days of their Gods.”</p>

<p>But to descend from the sublimity of mythology to
prosaic fact, we know that the Egyptians played at the
game of <i>Tau</i>, or Game of Robbers, afterwards the <i>Ludus
Latrunculorum</i> of the Romans, at that of <i>Hab em hau</i>, or
<i>The Game of the Bowl</i>, and at <i>Senat</i>, or <i>Draughts</i>. Of this
latter game we have ocular demonstration in the upper
Egyptian gallery of the British Museum, where, in a case
containing the throne, &amp;c., of Queen Hatasu (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1600)
are her draught board, and twenty pieces, ten of light-coloured
wood, nine of dark wood, and one of ivory&mdash;all
having a lion’s head. These were all, probably, games of
skill; but in the same case is an ivory Astragal, the earliest
known form of dice, which could have been of no use
except for gambling. The Astragal, which is familiarly
known to us as a “knuckle bone,” or “huckle bone,” is still
used by anatomists, as the name of a bone in the hind leg
of cloven footed animals which articulates with the tibia,
and helps to form the ankle joint. The bones used in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
gambling were, generally, those of sheep; but the Astragals
of the antelope were much prized on account of their superior
elegance. They also had regular dice, numbered like ours,
which have been found at Thebes and elsewhere; and,
although there are none in our national museum, there
are some in that of Berlin; but these are not considered
to be of great antiquity. The Egyptians also played at
the game of <i>Atep</i>, which is exactly like the favourite Italian
game of Mora, or guessing at the number of fingers extended.
Over a picture of two Egyptians playing at this
gambling game is written, “Let it be said”: or, as we
might say, “Guess,” or “How Many?” Sometimes they
played the game back to back, and then a third person had
to act as referee.</p>

<p>The Chinese and Indian games of skill, such as Chess,
are of great antiquity; but, perhaps, the oldest game is that
of <i>Enclosing</i>, called <i>Wei-ki</i> in Chinese, and <i>Go</i> in Japanese.
It is said to have been invented by the Emperor Yao,
2300 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, but the earliest record of the game is in 300
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> It is a game like <i>Krieg spiel</i>, a game of war. There
are not only typical representatives of the various arms, but
the armies themselves, some 200 men on each side; they
form encampments, and furnish them with defences; and
they slay, not merely a single man, as in other games, but,
frequently, hosts of men. There is no record of its being a
gambling game, but the modern Chinese is an inveterate
gambler.</p>

<p>As far as we know, the ancient Jews did not gamble
except by drawing, or casting lots; and as we find no
word against it in the inspired writings, and, as even one of
the apostles was chosen by lot (Acts i. 26), it must be
assumed that this form of gambling meets with the Divine
approval. We are not told how the lots were <i>drawn</i>; but
the <i>casting</i> of lots pre-supposes the use of dice, and this
seems to have been practised from very early times, for we
find in Lev. xvi. 8, that “Aaron shall cast lots upon the
two goats; one lot for the Lord, and the other lot for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
scape goat.” And the promised land was expressly and
divinely ordained to be divided by an appeal to chance.
Num. xxvi. 52 and 55, 56, “And the Lord spake unto
Moses, saying.... Notwithstanding the land shall be
divided by lot: according to the names of the tribes of
their fathers they shall inherit. According to the lot shall
the possession thereof be divided between many and few.”
The reader can find very many more references to the use of
the “lot” in any Concordance of the Bible. But in their
later days, as at the present time, the Jews did gamble, as
Disney<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> tells us when writing on Gaming amongst the
Jews.</p>

<p>“Though they had no written law for it, Gamesters were
<i>excluded from the Magistracy</i>, incapable of being chosen into
the greater or lesser Sanhedrim; nor could they be admitted
as <i>Witnesses</i> in any Court of Justice, till they were
perfectly reformed. Some of their reasons for excluding
such from the Magistracy were, that their gaming gave
sufficient presumption of their <i>Avarice</i>, and, besides, was
an employment <i>no way conducing to the public good</i>: a
covetous man, and one who is not wise and public spirited,
being very unfit for offices of so much trust and power, as
well as dignity. The presumption of <i>Avarice</i> was the
cause, also (and a very good one), of not admitting <i>the
evidence</i> of such a man. And that other notion they had,
that the gain arising from play was a <i>sort of Rapine</i>, is
as just a ground for the <i>Infamy</i> which stained his character,
and subjected him to these incapacities.</p>

<p>“This last consideration, that money won by gaming was
looked upon as got by <i>Theft</i>, makes it reasonable to conclude
that such money was to be <i>restored</i>, and that the
winning gamester was <i>punished</i> as for <i>Theft</i>: which was
not, by their law, a capital crime; but answered for, in
smaller cases (and, probably, in this, among the rest), by
<i>double Restitution</i>: Exod. xxii. 9.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>“But the partiality of that people is evident, in extending
the notion of Theft, only to <i>Gaming amongst themselves</i>;
<i>i.e.</i>, native Jews and proselytes of righteousness; for, if a
Jew played, and won of a Gentile, it was no Theft in him:
but it was forbidden to him on another account, as Gaming
is an application of mind entirely useless to human society.
For, say the Talmudists, ‘Tho’ he that games with a
Gentile does not offend against the prohibition of Theft,
he violates that <i>de rebus inanibus non incumbendo</i>: it does
not become a man, at any time of his life, to make anything
his business which does not relate to the study of
wisdom or the public good.’ Now, as this was only a
prohibition of their doctors, perhaps the law, or usage in
such cases might take place, that the offender was to be
scourged.”</p>

<p>Among the Greeks and Romans the first gambling implement
was the ἀστραγαλος, or (Lat.) <i>Talus</i>, before spoken of.
In the course of time the sides were numbered, and, afterwards,
they were made of ivory, onyx, &amp;c., specimens of
which may be seen in the Etruscan Saloon of the British
Museum, Case N. In the Terra Cotta room is a charming
group of two girls playing with Astragals, and in the Third
Vase room, on Stand I., is a vase, or drinking vessel, in the
shape of an Astragal (E. 804). Subsequently the Tessera,
or cubical die, similar to that now used, came into vogue
(samples of which may be seen in Case N. in the Etruscan
Saloon), and they were made of ivory, bone, porcelain, and
stone. Loaded dice have been found in Pompeii. They
also had other games among the Romans, such as <i>Par et
Impar</i> (odd or even), in which almonds, beans, or anything
else, were held in the hand, and guessed at&mdash;and the modern
Italian game of Mora was also in vogue.</p>

<p>But gambling was looked down upon in Rome, and the
term <i>aleator</i>, or gambler, was one of reproach&mdash;and many
were the edicts against it: utterly useless, of course, but it
was allowed during the Saturnalia. Money lost at play
could not be legally recovered by the winner, and money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>

paid by the loser might by him be recovered from the person
who had won and received the same.</p>

<p>The excavations at Pompeii and other places in modern
times have revealed things not known in writings; and,
treating of the subject of gambling, we are much indebted
to Sig. Rodolfo Lanciani, Professor of Archæology in the
University of Rome. Among other things, he tells us how,
in the spring of 1876, during the construction of the Via
Volturno, near the Prætorian Camp, a Roman tavern was
discovered, containing besides many hundred amphoræ, the
“sign” of the establishment engraved on a marble slab.</p>

</table>

<p class="p1">The meaning of this sign is double: it tells the customers
that a good supper was always ready within, and that the
gaming tables were always open to gamblers. The sign, in
fact, is a <i>tabula lusoria</i> in itself, as shown by the characteristic
arrangement of the thirty-six letters in three lines,
and six groups of six letters each. Orthography has been
freely sacrificed to this arrangement (<i>abemus</i> standing for
<i>habemus</i>, <i>cena</i> for <i>cenam</i>). The last word of the fourth
line shows that the men who patronised the establishment
were the <i>Venatores immunes</i>, a special troop of Prætorians,
into whose custody the <i>vivarium</i> of wild beasts and the
<i>amphitheatrum castrense</i> were given.</p>

<p>He also tells us that so intense was the love of the Roman
for games of hazard, that wherever he had excavated the
pavement of a portico, of a basilica, of a bath, or any flat
surface accessible to the public, he always found gaming
tables engraved or scratched on the marble or stone slabs for
the amusement of idle men, always ready to cheat each other
out of their money.</p>

<p>The evidence of this fact is to be found in the Forum, in
the Basilica Julia, in the corridors of the Coliseum, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
steps of the temple of Venus at Rome, in the square of the
front of the portico of the Twelve Gods, and even in the
House of the Vestals, after its secularisation in 393. Gaming
tables are especially abundant in barracks, such as those of
the seventh battalion of <i>vigiles</i>, near by St Critogono, and
of the police at Ostia and Porto, and of the Roman encampment
near Guise, in the Department of the Aisne. Sometimes
when the camp was moved from place to place, or else
from Italy to the frontiers of the empire, the men would not
hesitate to carry the heavy tables with their luggage. Two,
of pure Roman make, have been discovered at Rusicade, in
Numidia, and at Ain-Kebira, in Mauritania. Naturally enough
they could not be wanting in the Prætorian camp and in the
taverns patronised by its turbulent garrison, where the time
was spent in revelling and gambling, and in riots ending in
fights and bloodshed. To these scenes of violence the wording
of the tables often refers; such as</p>

<p class="p1">“Get up! You know nothing about the game; make
room for better players!” Two paintings were discovered,
in Nov. 1876, in a tavern at Pompeii, in one of which are
seen two players seated on stools opposite each other, and
holding on their knees the gaming table, upon which are
arranged, in various lines, several <i>latrunculi</i><a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> of various
colours, yellow, black and white. The man on the left
shakes a yellow dice box, and exclaims, “<i>Exsi</i>” (I am
out). The other points to the dice, and says, “<i>Non tria,
duas est</i>” (Not three points, but two). In the next picture
the same individuals have sprung to their feet, and show
fight. The younger says, “Not two, but three; I have
the game!” Whereupon, the other man, after flinging at
him the grossest insult, repeats his assertion, “Ego fui.”
The altercation ends with the appearance of the tavernkeeper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
who pushes both men into the street, and exclaims,
“Itis foris rix satis” (Go out of my shop if you want to
fight).</p>

<p>During Sig. Lanciani’s lifetime, a hundred, or more, tables
have been found in Rome, and they belong to six different
games of hazard; in some of them the mere chance of dice-throwing
was coupled with a certain amount of skill in
moving the men. Their outline is always the same: there
are three horizontal lines at an equal distance, each line
containing twelve signs&mdash;thirty-six in all. The signs vary
in almost every table; there are circles, squares, vertical
bars, leaves, letters, monograms, crosses, crescents and immodest
symbols: the majority of these tables (sixty-five)
contain words arranged so as to make a full sentence with
the thirty-six letters. These sentences speak of the fortune,
and good, or bad, luck of the game, of the skill and pluck of
the players, of the favour, or hostility, of bystanders and
betting men. Sometimes they invite you to try the seduction
of gambling, sometimes they warn of the risks incurred.</p>

<p>Children were initiated into the seductions of gambling
by playing “nuts,” a pastime cherished also by elder people.
In the spring of 1878 a life-size statuette of a boy playing
at nuts was discovered in the cemetery of the Agro Verano,
near St Lorenzo fuori le mura. The statuette, cut in Pentelic
marble, represents the young gambler leaning forward,
as if he had thrown, or was about to throw, the nut; and his
countenance shows anxiety and uncertainty as to the success
of his trial.</p>

<p>The game could be played in several ways. One, still
popular among Italian boys, was to make a pyramidal
“castle” with four nuts, three at the base and one on the
top, and then to try and knock it down with the fifth
nut thrown from a certain distance. Another way was
to design a triangle on the floor with chalk, subdividing
it into several compartments by means of lines parallel to
the base; the winnings were regulated according to the
compartment in which the nut fell and remained. Italian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
boys are still very fond of this game, which they call
<i>Campana</i>, because the figure drawn on the floor is in the
shape of a bell: it is played with coppers. There was a
third game at nuts, in which the players placed their stakes
in a vase with a large opening. The one who succeeded
first in throwing his missile inside the jar would gain its
contents.</p>

<p>They also tossed “head or tail,” betting on which side
a piece of money, thrown up in the air, would come down.
The Greeks used for this game a shell, black on one side,
white on the other, and called it “Night or day.” The
Romans used a copper “<i>as</i>” with the head of Janus on one
side, and the prow of a galley on the other, and they called
their game <i>Capita aut navim</i> (head or ship).</p>

<p>Mahomet discountenanced gambling, as we find in the
Koran (Sale’s translation, Lon. 1734), p. 25. “They will
ask thee concerning wine and lots. Answer: In both there
is great sin, and also some things of use unto men; but
their sinfulness is greater than their use.” Sale has explanatory
footnotes. He says “Lots. The original word,
<i>al Meiser</i>, properly signifies a particular game performed
with arrows, and much in use with the pagan Arabs. But
by Lots we are here to understand all games whatsoever,
which are subject to chance or hazard, as dice, cards, &amp;c.”
And, again, on p. 94. “O true believers, surely wine, and
lots, and images, and divining arrows are an abomination
of the work of Satan; therefore avoid them, that ye may
prosper.”</p>

<p><i>À propos</i> of this denunciation of gambling in the Koran, is
the following highly interesting letter of Emmanuel Deutsch,
in the <i>Athenæum</i> of Sep. 28, 1867:&mdash;</p>

<p>“It may interest the writer of the note on κυβεια (Eph. iv.
14), (the only word for ‘gambling’ used in the Bible) in your
recent ‘Weekly Gossip,’ to learn that this word was in very
common use among Paul’s kith and kin for ‘cube,’ ‘dice,’
‘dicery,’ and occurs frequently in the Talmud and Midrash.
As Aristotle couples a dice player (κυβευτης) with a ‘bath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
robber’ (λωποδυτης), and with a ‘thief’ (ληστης&mdash;a word no
less frequently used in the Talmud); so the Mishnah
declares unfit either as judge or witness ‘a κυβεια-player,
a usurer, a pigeon-flyer (betting man), a vender of illegal
(seventh year) produce, and a slave.’ A mitigating clause&mdash;proposed
by one of the weightiest legal authorities, to the
effect that the gambler and his kin should only be disqualified
‘if they have but that one profession’&mdash;is distinctly
negatived by the majority, and the rule remains absolute.
The classical word for the gambler, or dice player, appears
aramaized in the same sources into something like <i>kubiustis</i>,
as the following curious instances may show. When the
Angel, after having wrestled with Jacob all night, asks him
to let him go, ‘for the dawn hath risen,’ Jacob is made to
reply to him, ‘Art thou a thief, or a <i>kubiustis</i>, that thou art
afraid of the day?’ To which the Angel replies, ‘No, I am
not; but it is my turn to-day, and for the first time, to sing
the Angelic Hymn of Praise in Heaven: let me go.’”</p>

<p>In another Talmudical passage, an early Biblical critic is
discussing certain arithmetical difficulties in the Pentateuch.
Thus, he finds the number of the Levites (in Numbers) to
differ, when summed up from the single items, from that given
in the total. Worse than that, he finds that all the gold and
silver contributed to the sanctuary is not accounted for; and,
clinching his argument, he cries, “Is then your Master,
Moses, a thief or a <i>kubiustis</i>?” The critic is then informed
of a certain difference between “sacred” and other coins,
and he further gets a lesson in the matter of Levites and
First-born, which silences him. Again, the Talmud decides
that if a man have bought a slave who turns out to be a
thief or a <i>kubiustis</i>&mdash;which has been erroneously explained
to mean a “man-stealer”&mdash;he has no redress. He must
keep him, as he bought him, or send him away, for he
bought him with all his vices.</p>

<p>No wonder dice-playing was tantamount to a crime in
those declining days. There was, notwithstanding the
severe laws against it, hardly a more common and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
ruinous pastime&mdash;a pastime in which Cicero himself, who
places a gambler on a par with an adulterer, did not disdain
to indulge in his old days, claiming it as a privilege of
“Age.” Augustus was a passionate dice-player. Nero
played the points&mdash;for they also played it by points&mdash;at
400,000 sesterces. Caligula, after a long spell of ill-luck,
in which he had lost all his money, rushed into the streets,
had two innocent Roman knights seized, and ordered their
goods to be confiscated. Whereupon he returned to his
game, remarking that this had been the luckiest throw he
had had for a long time. Claudius had his carriages
arranged for dicing convenience, and wrote a work on the
subject. Nor was it all fair play with those ancients.
Aristotle already knows of a way by which the dice can be
made to fall as the player wishes them; and even the cunningly
constructed, turret-shaped dice cup did not prevent
occasional “mendings” of luck. The Berlin Museum contains
one “charged” die, and another with a double four.
The great affection for this game is seen, among other
things, by the common proverbs taken from it, and the no
less than sixty-four names given to the different throws,
taken from kings, heroes, gods, hetairæ, animals, and the
rest. But the word was also used in a mathematical sense.
In a cosmogonical discussion of the Midrash, the earth is
likened to a “cubus.”</p>

<p>The use of dice in England is of great antiquity, dating
from the advent of the Saxons and the Danes and Romans;
indeed, all the northern nations were passionately addicted
to gambling. Tacitus (<i>de Moribus Germ.</i>) tells us that the
ancient Germans would not only hazard all their wealth, but
even stake their liberty upon the throw of the dice; “and
he who loses submits to servitude, though younger and
stronger than his antagonist, and patiently permits himself
to be bound, and sold in the market; and this <i>madness</i> they
dignify by the name of <i>honour</i>.”</p>

<p>In early English times we get occasional glimpses of
gambling with dice. Ordericus Vitalis (1075-1143) tells<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
us that “the clergymen and bishops are fond of dice-playing”&mdash;and
John of Salisbury (1110-1182) calls it “the
damnable art of dice-playing.” In 1190 a curious edict
was promulgated, which shows how generally gambling prevailed
even among the lower classes at that period. This
edict was established for the regulation of the Christian
army under the command of Richard the First of England
and Philip of France during the Crusade. It prohibits any
person in the army, beneath the degree of knight, from playing
at any sort of game for money: knights and clergymen
might play for money, but none of them were permitted to
lose more than twenty shillings in one whole day and night,
under a penalty of one hundred shillings, to be paid to the
archbishops in the army. The two monarchs had the privilege
of playing for what they pleased, but their attendants
were restricted to the sum of twenty shillings, and, if they
exceeded, they were to be whipped naked through the army
for three days. The decrees established by the Council held
at Worcester in the twenty-fourth year of Henry III. prohibited
the clergy from playing at <i>dice</i> or <i>chess</i>, but neither
the one nor the other of these games are mentioned in the
succeeding statutes before the twelfth year of Richard II.,
when <i>diceing</i> is particularised and expressly forbidden.</p>

<p>The letter books of the Corporation of the City of London,
during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, give us several
examples of diceing. “4 Ed. II., <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1311. Elmer de
Multone was attached, for that he was indicted in the Ward
of Chepe for being a common night walker; and, in the day,
is wont to entice strangers and persons unknown, to a tavern,
and there deceive them by using false dice. And, also, for
that he was indicted in Tower Ward, for being a bruiser
and night walker, against the peace; as, also, for being a
common <i>rorere</i>.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> And, also, for that he was indicted in the
Ward of Crepelgate for playing at dice, and for that he is
wont to entice men into a tavern, and to make them play at
dice there against their will. He appeared, and, being asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
how he would acquit himself thereof, he said that he was not
guilty, and put himself upon the country as to the same.
And the jury came, by Adam Trugge and others, on the
panel; and they said, upon their oath, that he is guilty of
all the trespasses aforesaid. Therefore he was committed to
prison,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>The next is from a Proclamation made for the safe
keeping of the City. 8 Ed., III. <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1334. “Also, we do
forbid, on the same pain of imprisonment, that any man
shall go about, at this Feast of Christmas, with companions
disguised with false faces,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> or in any other manner, to the
houses of the good folks of the City, for playing at dice
there; but let each one keep himself quiet and at his ease
within his own house.”</p>

<p>“50 Ed. III., <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1376. Nicholas Prestone, tailor, and
John Outlawe, were attached to make answer to John atte
Hille, and William, his brother, in a plea of deceit and
falsehood; for that the same John Outlawe, at divers times
between the Feast of Our Lord’s Nativity, in the 49th
year, &amp;c., and the First Sunday in Lent, then next ensuing,
came to the said John atte Hille and William, and asked if
they wished to gain some money at tables or at chequers,
commonly called ‘<i>quek</i>’; to which they said ‘Yes’; whereupon
the same John Outlawe said they must follow him,
and he would show them the place, and a man there, from
whom they could easily win; and further said that he would
be partner with them, to win or to lose.</p>

<p>“And they followed him to the house of the said Nicholas
in Friday Street, and there they found the said Nicholas with
a pair of tables, on the outside of which was painted a chequer
board, that is called a ‘<i>quek</i>.’ And the said Nicholas
asked them if they would play at tables for money; whereupon
the said complainants, knowing of no deceit, or ill-intent,
being urged and encouraged thereto by the same
John Outlawe, played with him at tables and lost a sum of
money, owing to false dice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>“And the said John then left them to play alone; and, after
that, they still continued to lose. The said tables were then
turned, and the complainants played with the defendant
Nicholas at ‘<i>quek</i>’ until they had lost at the games of
tables and <i>quek</i> 39s. 2d. After which the complainants,
wondering at their continued losing, examined the board
at which they had been playing and found it to be false
and deceptive; seeing that in three quarters of the board
all the black points were so depressed that all the white
points in the same quarters were higher than the black
points in the same; and, on the fourth quarter of the
board, all the white points were so depressed that all the
black points in that quarter were higher than the white.
They inspected and examined also the dice with which they
had first played at tables, and found them to be false and
defective. And, because they would play no longer, the
said Nicholas and John Outlawe stripped John atte Hille of
of a cloak, 16 shillings in value, which they still retained.”</p>

<p>They were found guilty and sentenced to return the
money lost and the cloak, or its value, and “Afterwards,
on the prosecution of Ralph Strode, Common Serjeant of
the said City, by another jury, they were found guilty of
the fraud and deception so imputed to them. Therefore it
was awarded that they should have the punishment of the
pillory, to stand thereon for one hour in the day, and that
the said false chequer board should be burnt beneath them,
the Sheriff causing the reason for their punishment to be proclaimed.
And, after that, they were to be taken back to
the Prison of Newgate, there to remain until the Mayor and
Aldermen should give orders for their release.”</p>

<p>And so dicing went on, unimpaired in popularity, in spite
of legal fulminations, until Elizabeth’s time, when we probably
hear more of it, owing to the greater dissemination
of literature in that reign. In 1551 there was a famous
murder, in which Mr Arden of Feversham was killed whilst
playing a game of tables with one Mosbie, the paramour of
his wife, who had made Mosbie a present of a pair of <i>silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
dice</i> to reconcile a disagreement that had subsisted between
them. Shakespeare mentions dice and dicing thirteen times
in seven plays, and in Jonson, and the early dramatists, there
are many allusions to this species of gambling.</p>

<p>In the British Museum is a little MS. book<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> called
“New Passages and Jests,” which were collected by Sir
Nicholas L’Estrange of Hunstanton, Bart., who died in
1669, and in one of the anecdotes we get an insight into
cheating at dice. “Sir William Herbert, playing at dice
with another gentleman, there arose some questions about a
cast. Sir William’s antagonist declared it was a four and a
five; he as positively insisted that it was a five and a six:
the other then swore with a bitter imprecation that it was as
he said. Sir William then replied, ‘Thou art a perjured
knave; for, give me a sixpence, and if there be a four upon
the dice, I will return you a thousand pounds’; at which
the other was presently abashed, for, indeed, the dice were
false, and of a <i>high cut</i>, without a four.”</p>

<p>Charles Cotton, in his <i>Compleat Gamester</i>, gives us a vivid
account of dicing, as it then was, at an ordinary, after dark.</p>

<p>“The day being shut in, you may properly compare this
place to those Countries which lye far in the North, where
it is as clear at midnight as at noonday.... This is
the time (when ravenous beasts usually seek their prey)
when in comes shoals of <i>Huffs</i>, <i>Hectors</i>, <i>Setters</i>, <i>Gilts</i>, <i>Pads</i>,
<i>Biters</i>, <i>Divers</i>, <i>Lifters</i>, <i>Filers</i>, <i>Budgies</i>, <i>Droppers</i>, <i>Crossbyters</i>,
&amp;c., and these may all pass under the general and common
appellation of <i>Rooks</i>.... Some of these <i>Rooks</i> will be very
importunate to borrow money of you without any intention
to pay you; or to go with you seven to twelve, half a crown,
or more, whereby, without a very great chance (ten to one, or
more), he is sure to win. If you are sensible hereof, and
refuse his proposition, they will take it so ill, that, if you
have not an especiall care, they will pick your pocket, nim
your gold or silver buttons off your Cloak or Coat, or, it
may be, draw your silver-hilted sword out of your belt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
without discovery, especially if you are eager upon your
Cast, which is done thus: the silver buttons are strung, or
run upon Cats guts fastened at the upper and nether ends;
now, by ripping both ends very ingeniously, give it the
gentle pull, and so rub off with the buttons; and, if your
Cloak be loose, ‘tis ten to one they have it.</p>

<p>“But that which will provoke (in my opinion) any man’s
rage to a just satisfaction, is their throwing many times at
a good Sum with a <i>dry fist</i>; (as they call it) that is, if they
nick you, ‘tis theirs; if they lose, they owe you so much,
with many other quillets: some I have known so abominably
impudent, that they would snatch up the Stakes, and, thereupon,
instantly draw, saying, if you will have your money,
you must fight for it; for he is a Gentleman, and will not
want: however, if you will be patient, he will pay you
another time; if you are so tame as to take this, go no more
to the Ordinary; for then the whole Gang will be ever and
anon watching an opportunity to make a <i>Mouth</i> of you in
the like nature. If you nick them, ‘tis odds, if they wait
not your coming out at night and beat you: I could produce
you an hundred examples of this kind, but they will rarely
adventure on the attempt, unless they are backt with some
<i>Bully-Huffs</i> and <i>Bully-Rocks</i>, with others, whose fortunes
are as desperate as their own. We need no other testimony
to confirm the danger of associating with these Anthropophagi,
or Man-Eaters, than Lincolns Inn Fields, whilst
<i>Speering’s</i> Ordinary was kept in Bell Yard, and that you do
not want a pair of Witnesses for the proof thereof, take in,
also, Covent Garden.</p>

<p>“Neither is it the House itself to be exempted; every
night, almost, some one or other, who, either heated with
Wine, or made cholerick with the loss of his Money, raises
a quarrel, swords are drawn, box and candlesticks thrown
at one another’s heads. Tables overthrown, and all the
House in such a Garboyl, that it is the perfect type of Hell.
Happy is the man now that can make the frame of a Table
or Chimney corner his Sanctuary; and, if any are so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
fortunate as to get to the Stair head, they will rather
hazard the breaking of their own necks, than have their
souls pushed out of their bodies in the dark by they know
not whom.</p>

<p>“I once observed one of the <i>Desperadoes</i> of the Town,
(being half drunk) to press a Gentleman very much to
lend him a crown: the Gentleman refus’d him several
times, yet, still, the Borrower persisted; and, holding his
head too near the <i>Caster’s</i> elbow, it chanced to hit his nose:
the other, thinking it to be affront enough to be denied the
loan of Money, without this slight touch of the nose, drew,
and, stepping back, (unawares to the Gentleman) made a
full pass at him, intending to have run him through the
body; but his drunkenness misguided his hand, so that he
ran him only through the arm: this put the house into so
great a confusion and fright, that some fled, thinking the
Gentleman slain. This wicked Miscreant thought not this
sufficient; but, tripping up his heels, pinn’d him, as he
thought to the floor: and after this, takes the Gentleman’s
silver sword, leaving his in the wound, and, with a <i>Grand Jury</i>
of <i>Dammees</i>, bid all stand off, if they lov’d their lives, and, so,
went clear off with sword and liberty, but was, notwithstanding,
(the Gentleman recovering) compel’d to make what satisfaction
he was capable of making, beside a long imprisonment;
and was not long abroad, before he was apprehended for
Burglary committed, condemned, and justly executed.</p>

<p>“But, to proceed on as to play: late at night, when the
company grows thin, and your eyes dim with watching,
false Dice are frequently put upon the ignorant, or they are
otherwise cheated by <i>Topping</i>, <i>Slurring</i>, <i>Stabbing</i>, &amp;c., and,
if you be not vigilant and careful, the box-keeper shall
score you up double, or treble Boxes; and, though you have
lost your money, dun you as severely for it, as if it were
the justest debt in the world.</p>

<p>“The more subtile and genteeler sort of <i>Rooks</i>, you shall
not distinguish, by their outward demeanour, from persons of
condition; these will sit by, a whole evening, and observe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
who wins; if the winner be <i>bubbleable</i>, they will insinuate
themselves into his company, by applauding his success,
advising him to leave off while he is well: and, lastly, by
civilly inviting him to drink a glass of wine, where, having
well warm’d themselves to make him more than half
drunk, they wheadle him in to play: to which, if he condescend,
he shall quickly have no money left him in his
pocket, unless, perchance, a Crown the Rooking winner lent
him, in courtesie, to bear his charges homewards.</p>

<p>“This they do by false Dice, as <i>High Fullams</i>, 4. 5. 6.
<i>Low Fullams</i>, 1. 2. 3. By <i>Bristle</i> Dice, which are fitted for
their purpose by sticking a Hog’s bristle, so in the corners,
or otherwise in the Dice, that they shall run high, or low, as
they please. This bristle must be strong and short, by
which means, the bristle bending, it will not lie on that side,
but will be tript over; and this is the newest way of making
a high, or low <i>Fullam</i>. The old ways are by drilling them,
and loading them with quicksilver; but that cheat may be
easily discovered by their weight, or holding two corners
between your forefinger and thumb; if, holding them so,
gently between your fingers, they turn, you may conclude
them false: or, you may try their falsehood otherwise, by
breaking, or splitting them. Others have made them by
filing and rounding; but all these ways fall short of the Art
of those who make them; some whereof are so admirably
skilful in making a Bale of Dice to run what you would
have them, that your Gamesters think they can never give
enough for their purchase, if they prove right. They are
sold in many places about the Town; price current, (by the
help of a friend) eight shillings; whereas an ordinary Bale
is sold for sixpence: for my part, I shall tell you plainly, I
would have those Bales of false Dice to be sold at the price
of the ears of such destructive knaves that made them.</p>

<p>“Another way the Rook hath to cheat, is first by <i>Palming</i>,
that is, he puts one Dye into the Box, and keeps the
other in the hollow of his little finger; which, noting what
is uppermost when he takes him up, the same shall be when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
he throws the other Dye, which runs doubtfully, any cast.
Observe this&mdash;that the bottom and top of all Dice are <i>Seven</i>,
so that if it be four above, it must be a 3 at bottom; so 5
and 2, 6 and 1. Secondly, by <i>Topping</i>, and that is when
they take up both Dice, and seem to put them in the Box;
and, shaking the Box, you would think them both there, by
reason of the rattling occasioned with the screwing of the
Box; whereas, one of them is at the top of the box, between
his two forefingers, or secur’d by thrusting a forefinger into
the Box. Thirdly, by <i>Slurring</i>: that is, by taking up your
Dice as you will have them advantageously lie in your hand,
placing the one a top the other, not caring if the uppermost
run a Millstone, (as they used to say) if the undermost run
without turning, and, therefore, a smooth table is altogether
requisite for this purpose: on a rugged rough board, it is a
hard matter to be done, whereas, on a smooth table (the
best are rub’d over with Bee’s Wax to fill up all chinks and
crevices) it is usual for some to slur a Dye two yards, or
more, without turning. Fourthly&mdash;by <i>Knapping</i>: that is,
when you strike a Dye dead, that it shall not stir. This is
best done within the Tables; where, note, there is no securing
but of one Dye, although there are some, who boast of
securing both. I have seen some so dexterous at Knapping,
that they have done it through the handle of a quart-pot,
or, over a Candle and Candlestick: but that which I most
admired, was throwing the same, less than Ames Ace, with
two Dice, upon a Groat held in the left hand, on the one side
of the handle, a foot distance, and the Dice thrown with the
right hand on the other.</p>

<p>“Lastly&mdash;by <i>Stabbing</i>&mdash;that is, having a Smooth Box,
and small in the bottom, you drop in both your Dice in such
manner as you would have them sticking therein, by reason
of its narrowness, the Dice lying upon one another; so that,
turning up the Box, the Dice never tumble; if a smooth
Box, if true, but little; by which means you have bottoms
according to the tops you put in; for example&mdash;if you put
in your Dice so that two fives or two fours lie a top, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
have, in the bottom, turned up two twos, or two treys; so,
if Six and Ace a top, a Six and an Ace at bottom.”</p>

<p>At this time were played several games requiring tables
and dice, such as <i>Irish</i>; <i>Backgammon</i>; <i>Tick-tack</i>; <i>Doublets</i>;
<i>Sice-Ace</i> and <i>Catch-Dolt</i>; whilst the games requiring no
special tables were <i>In and In</i>; <i>Passage</i> and <i>Hazard</i>, which
latter was the game most usually played, and of which
Cotton remarks “Certainly, Hazard is the most bewitching
game that is played on the Dice; for when a man begins to
play, he knows not when to leave off; and, having once
accustomed himself to play at Hazard, he hardly, ever after,
minds anything else.”</p>

<p>Ned Ward<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> (1663-1714), of course, mentions gamblers
and gambling, but his experiences are of low Coffee Houses
and Alsatia: and, presumably most of the Gambling Houses
were of that type, for Thomas Brown<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> (1663-1704) speaks
of them as follows. “In some places they call Gaming
Houses <i>Academies</i>; but I know not why they should inherit
that honourable name, since there is nothing to be learn’d
there, unless it be <i>Sleight of Hand</i>, which is sometimes at
the Expence of all our Money, to get that of other Men’s by
Fraud and Cunning. The Persons that meet are generally
Men of an <i>Infamous</i> character, and are in various Shapes,
Habits, and Employments. Sometimes they are Squires of
the <i>Pad</i>, and now and then borrow a little Money upon the
<i>King’s High Way</i>, to recruit their losses at the <i>Gaming
House</i>; and, when a Hue and Cry is out to apprehend them,
they are as safe in one of these Houses as a <i>Priest</i> at the
<i>Altar</i>, and practise the old trade of <i>Cross-biting Cullies</i>,
assisting the frail <i>Square Die</i> with high and low <i>Fullams</i>,
and other napping tricks, in comparison of whom the
common Bulkers and Pickpockets, are a very honest society.
How unaccountable is this way to <i>Beggary</i>, that when a man
has but a little money, or knows not where in the world to
compass any more, unless by hazarding his neck for’t, will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
try an experiment to leave himself none at all: or, he that
has money of his own should play the fool, and try whether
it shall not be another man’s. Was ever anything so nonsensically
pleasant?</p>

<p>“One idle day I ventured into one of these <i>Gaming
Houses</i>, where I found an <i>Oglio of Rakes</i> of several Humours
and Conditions met together. Some of them had never a
Penny left them to bless their Heads with. One that had
play’d away even his Shirt and Cravat, and all his Clothes
but his Breeches, stood shivering in a Corner of the Room,
and another comforting him, and saying, <i>Damme</i> Jack,
whoever thought to see thee in a State of Innocency: cheer
up, Nakedness is the best Receipt in the World against a
Fever; and then fell a Ranting as if Hell had broke loose
that very Moment.... I told my friend, instead of
<i>Academies</i> these places should be called <i>Cheating Houses</i>:
Whereupon a Bully of the <i>Blade</i> came strutting up to my
very Nose, in such a Fury, that I would willingly have given
half the Teeth in my Head for a Composition, crying out,
Split my Wind Pipe, Sir, you are a Fool, and don’t understand
<i>Trap</i>, the whole World’s a Cheat.”</p>

<p>In the reigns of Charles II., James II., William III.,
and Queen Anne were many notorious gamblers, such as
Count Konigsmarck, St Evremont, Beau Fielding, Col.
Macartney, who was Lord Mohun’s second in his celebrated
duel with the Duke of Hamilton, and the Marquis de
Guiscard, who stabbed Harley, Earl of Oxford. There is a
little book by Theophilus Lucas,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> which gives a more or less
accurate life of notorious gamblers of those days; amongst
them there is a notice of Col. Panton, of whom Lucas says:
“There was no Game but what he was an absolute Artist at,
either upon the Square, or foul Play: as at <i>English Ruff
and Honours</i>, <i>Whist</i>, <i>French Ruff</i>, <i>Gleek</i>, <i>L’Ombre</i>, <i>Lanterloo</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
<i>Bankafalet</i>, <i>Beast</i>, <i>Basset</i>, <i>Brag</i>, <i>Piquet</i>: he was very
dextrous also at <i>Verquere</i>, <i>Tick-tack</i>, <i>Grand Trick-track</i>,
<i>Irish</i> and <i>Back-Gammon</i>; which are all Games play’d
within Tables; and he was not Ignorant of <i>Inn and Inn</i>,
<i>Passage</i> and <i>Draughts</i>, which are Games play’d without the
Tables. Moreover, he had great skill at <i>Billiards</i> and
<i>Chess</i>; but, above all, his chief game was at <i>Hazard</i>, at
which he got the most Money; for, in one Night, at this
Play, he won as many thousand pounds as purchased him
an Estate of above £1500 <i>per Annum</i>, insomuch as he built
a whole Street near <i>Leicester-fields</i>, which, after his own
name, he called <i>Panton Street</i>. After this good Fortune, he
had such an Aversion against all manner of Games, that he
would never handle Cards nor Dice again, but liv’d very
handsomely on his Winnings to his dying Day, which was in
the year 1681.”</p>

<p>Perhaps the most amusing of Lucas’s <i>Lives</i> is that of
Richard Bourchier&mdash;about whom I extract the following
anecdotes. “Fortune not favouring Mr <i>Bourchier</i> always
alike, he was reduced to such a very low Ebb, that, before
he was Four-and-twenty, he was obliged to be a Footman to
the Right Honourable the Earl of <i>Mulgrave</i>, now Duke of
<i>Buckingham</i>; in this Nobleman’s Service he wore a Livery
above a year and a half, when, by his genteel Carriage and
Mien, marrying one Mrs <i>Elizabeth</i> Gossinn, a Lace Woman’s
Grand Daughter, in <i>Exeter Change</i> in the <i>Strand</i>, with whom
he had about 150 Pounds; it being then the solemn
Festival of <i>Christmas</i>, in the Twelve Days whereof, great
Raffling was then wont to be kept in the <i>Temple</i>, he carried
his Wife’s Portion thither to improve it, but was so unsuccessful
as to lose every Farthing. This ill Luck made Mr
<i>Bourchier</i> Stark Mad; but, borrowing 20 Pounds of a
Friend, he went to the <i>Temple</i> again, but had first bought a
Twopenny Cord to hang himself, in case he lost that too:
but the Dice turning on his side, and having won his own
Money back again, and as much more to it, of one particular
Gentleman who was now fretting and fuming in as bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
manner as <i>Bourchier</i> was before, he very courteously pull’d
the cord out of his pocket, and giving it to the Loser, said,
<i>Having now, Sir, no occasion for this Implement myself, it is
at your Service with all my Heart</i>: Which bantering expression
made the Gentleman look very sour upon the Winner,
who carried off his booty whilst he was well.”</p>

<p>He grew prosperous, and got into high society, as bookmakers
and others now do at Horse Races; for we find that
“being at the <i>Groom Porter’s</i>, he flung one Main with the
Earl of <i>Mulgrave</i> for £500, which he won; and his
Honour, looking wistly at him, quoth he: <i>I believe I should
know you. Yes</i>, (replied the winner), <i>your Lordship must
have some knowledge of me, for my Name is</i> Dick Bourchier,
<i>who was once your Footman</i>. Whereupon, his Lordship,
supposing that he was not in a Capacity of paying 500
pounds in case he had lost, cry’d out, <i>A Bite, A Bite</i>. But
the <i>Groom Porter</i> assuring his Honour that Mr <i>Bourchier</i> was
able to have paid 1000 pounds, provided his Lordship had
won such a sum, he paid him what he plaid for, without any
farther Scruple.”</p>

<p>But he was not content to gamble with mere Earls, he
flew at higher game. “By the favour of some of his own
Nation, he was soon admitted to the presence of <i>Lewis le
grand</i>, as a Gamster: he not only won 15,000 Pistoles of
the King, but the Nobility also tasted of the same Fortune;
for he won 10,000 Pistoles of the Duke of <i>Orleans</i>; almost
as much of the Duke <i>D’Espernon</i>, besides many of his jewels,
and a prodigious large piece of Ambergreese, valued at
20,000 crowns, as being the greatest piece that ever was
seen in <i>Europe</i>, and which was afterwards laid up by the
Republick of <i>Venice</i> in their treasury, to whom it was sold
for a great Rarity.... Once, Mr <i>Bourchier</i> going over to
<i>Flanders</i>, with a great Train of Servants, set off in such a
fine Equipage, that they drew the Eyes of all upon them
wherever they went, to admire the Splendor and Gaiety of
their Master, whom they took for no less than a Nobleman
of the first Rank. In this Pomp, making his Tour at King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
<i>William’s</i> Tent, he happened into Play with that great
Monarch, and won of him above £2500. The Duke of
<i>Bavaria</i> being also there, he then took up the cudgels, and
losing £15,000, the Loss put him into a great Chafe, and
doubting some foul Play was put upon him, because Luck
went so much against him, quoth Mr <i>Bourchier</i>&mdash;<i>Sir, if
you have any suspicion of any sinister trick put upon your
Highness, if you please, I’ll give you a Chance for all your
Money at once, tossing up at Cross and Pile,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and you shall
have the advantage of throwing up the Guinea yourself</i>.
The Elector admir’d at his bold Challenge, which, nevertheless,
accepting, he tost up for £15,000, and lost the
Money upon Reputation, with which <i>Bourchier</i> was very well
satisfied, as not doubting in the least; and so, taking his
leave of the King and those Noblemen that were with him,
he departed. Then the Elector of <i>Bavaria</i>, enquiring of
his Majesty, who that Person was, that could run the Hazard
of playing for so much Money at a Time, he told him it was
a subject of his in <i>England</i>, that though he had no real
estate of his own, yet was he able to play with any Sovereign
Prince in <i>Germany</i>. Shortly after, <i>Bourchier</i> returning into
England, he bought a most rich Coach and curious Sett of
six Horses to it, which cost him above £3000, for a present
to the Elector of <i>Bavaria</i>, who had not yet paid him anything
of the £30,000 which he had won of him. Notice
hereof being sent to his Highness, the generous action incited
him to send over his Gentleman of Horse, into <i>England</i>, to
take care of this present, which he received kindly at
<i>Bourchier’s</i> Hands, to whom he return’d Bills of Exchange
also, drawn upon several eminent merchants in <i>London</i>, for
paying what money he had lost with him at play.”</p>

<p>Bourchier became very rich by gambling, and purchased
an estate near Pershore in Worcestershire, where he was
buried&mdash;but he died in London in 1702, aged 45.</p>

<p>Lucas tells a story about gamblers, which, although it
has no reference to England, is too good to leave out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>“But, for a farther unquestionable Testimony of the Mischiefs
that often arise from Gaming, this is a very remarkable, but
dreadful Passage, which I am now going to recite. Near
<i>Bellizona</i>, in <i>Switzerland</i>, Three Men were playing at Dice
on the <i>Sabbath Day</i>; and one of ‘em, call’d <i>Ulrick Schrœteus</i>,
having lost his Money, and, at last, expecting a good Cast,
broke out into a most blasphemous Speech, threatening,
<i>That, if Fortune deceiv’d him then, he would thrust his Dagger
into the very body of God, as far as he could</i>. The cast miscarrying,
the Villain drew his Dagger, and threw it against
Heaven with all his Strength; when, behold, the Dagger
vanish’d, and several Drops of Blood fell upon the table in
the midst of them: and the Devil immediately came and
carry’d away the blasphemous Wretch, with such a Noise and
Stink, that the whole City was amaz’d at it. The others,
half distracted with Fear, strove to wipe out the Drops of
Blood that were upon the Table, but the more they rubb’d
‘em, the more plainly they appear’d. The Rumour hereof
flying to the City, multitudes of People flock’d to the Place,
where they found the Gamesters washing the Board; whom
they bound in Chains, and carried towards the Prison; but,
as they were upon the way, one of ‘em was suddenly struck
dead, with such a Number of Lice crawling out of him, as
was wonderful and loathsome to behold: And the Third was
immediately put to Death by the Citizens, to avert the Divine
Indignation and Vengence, which seem’d to hang over their
heads. The Table was preserv’d in the Place, and kept as a
Monument of the Judgments of God on Blasphemers and
Sabbath-breakers; and to show the mischiefs and inconveniences
that often attend Gaming.”</p>

<p>Loaded Dice continued to be used&mdash;for on 18th April
1740 were committed to Newgate, on the oaths of seven
gentlemen of distinction, Thomas Lyell, Lawrence Sydney,
and John Roberts, for cheating and defrauding with false and
loaded dice, those particular gentlemen, at the Masquerade,
to the value of about £400, and other gentlemen not present
at the examination of about £4000 more; and out of about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
nine pairs of dice which were cut asunder, only one single
dice was found unloaded. For this, Lyell and Sidney stood
in the Pillory, near the Opera House, on 2nd June 1742,
two years after the offence was committed.</p>

<p>And two days afterwards, a cause was tried in the Court
of King’s Bench, on an indictment against a gentleman for
winning the sum of £500 at hazard about seven years before;
and, after a long trial, the jury found him guilty, the penalty
being £2500.</p>

<p>To show the prevalence of dicing, it may be mentioned
that when the floors of the Middle Temple Hall were taken
up somewhere about 1764, among other things were found
nearly one hundred pairs of dice which had fallen through
the chinks of the flooring. They were about one-third smaller
than those now in use. And Malcolm<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> says: “However unpleasant
the yells of barrow women with their commodities
are at present, no other mischief arises from them than the
obstruction of the ways. It was far otherwise before 1716
when they generally carried Dice with them, and children
were enticed to throw for fruit and nuts, or, indeed, any
persons of a more advanced age. However, in the year just
mentioned, the Lord Mayor issued an order to apprehend
all retailers so offending, which speedily put an end to street
gaming; though I am sorry to observe that some miscreants
now (1808) carry little wheels marked with numbers, which,
being turned, govern the chance by the figure a hand in the
centre points to when stopped.” When I was young the
itinerent vendors of sweets had a “dolly,” which was a rude
representation of a man, hollowed spirally; a marble was
dropped in at its head, and coming out at its toes, spun
round a board until it finally subsided into one of the numerous
numbered hollows it contained. When that was made
illegal, a numbered teetotum was used, and now childhood
is beguiled with the promise of a threepenny piece, or other
prize, to be found in packets of sweets.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="pch">Latimer and Cards&mdash;Discourse between a Preacher and a Professor&mdash;The Perpetual
Almanack, or Soldier’s Prayer Book&mdash;Origin of Playing Cards&mdash;Earliest
Notice&mdash;Royal Card Playing.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="beg">Before</span> going into the history, &amp;c., of playing cards, it may
be as well to note the serious application that was made of
them by some persons: and first, we will glance at the two
sermons of Latimer’s on cards, which he delivered in St
Edward’s Church, Cambridge, on the Sunday before
Christmas Day 1529. In these sermons he used the card
playing of the season for illustrations of spiritual truth.
By having recourse to a series of similes, drawn from the
rules of Primero and Trump, he illustrated his subject in a
manner that for some weeks after caused his pithy sentences
to be recalled at well nigh every social gathering; and his
Card Sermons became the talk both of Town and University.
The novelty of his method of treatment made it a complete
success; and it was felt throughout the University that
his shafts had told with more than ordinary effect. But, of
course, these sermons being preached in pre-Reformation
days, were considered somewhat heretical, and Buckenham,
the Prior of the Dominicans at Cambridge, tried to answer
Latimer in the same view. As Latimer derived his illustrations
from Cards, so did Buckenham from Dice, and he
instructed his hearers how they might confound Lutheranism
by throwing quatre and cinque: the quatre being the “four
doctors” of the Church, and the cinque being five passages
from the New Testament selected by the preacher.</p>

<p>Says Latimer in the first of these sermons: “Now then,
what is Christ’s rule? Christ’s rule consisteth in many
things, as in the Commandments, and the Works of Mercy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and so forth. And for because I cannot declare Christ’s
rule unto you at one time, as it ought to be done, I will
apply myself according to your custom at this time of
Christmas. I will, as I said, declare unto you Christ’s rule,
but that shall be in Christ’s Cards. And, whereas you are
wont to celebrate Christmas by playing at Cards, I intend,
by God’s grace to deal unto you Christ’s Cards, wherein you
shall perceive Christ’s rule. The game that we will play at
shall be called The Triumph, which, if it be well played at, he
that dealeth shall win; the players shall likewise win; and
the standers and lookers on shall do the same; insomuch
that no man that is willing to play at this Triumph with
these Cards, but they shall be all winners, and no losers.”</p>

<p>Next, is a curious little Black Letter tract, by James
Balmford published in 1593.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> It is a dialogue between a
Professor and a Preacher.</p>

<p>“<i>Professor.</i> Sir, howsoever I am perswaded by that which
I reade in the common places of <i>Peter Martyr, par. 2, pag.
525, b.</i> that Dice condemned both by the Civill lawes (and by
the Fathers), are therefore unlawfull, because they depend
upon chance; yet not satisfied with that which he writeth
of Table playing, <i>pag. 516, b.</i> I would crave your opinion
concerning playing at Tables and Cards.</p>

<p><i>Preacher.</i> Saving the judgement of so excellent a Divine,
so Farre as I can learne out of God’s word, Cardes and Tables
seeme to mee no more lawfull, (though less offensive) than
Dice. For Table playing is no whit the more lawfull, because
<i>Plato</i> compares the life of man thereunto, than a theefe is the
more justifiable, because Christ compareth his second coming
to burglarie in the night (Mat. xxiv. 43, 44). Againe, if
Dice be wholly evill, because they wholly depend upon chance,
then Tables and Cardes must needes be somewhat evill, because
they somewhat depend upon chance. Therefore, consider
well this reason, which condemneth the one as well
as the other: Lots are not to be used in sport; but games<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
consisting in chance, as Dice, Cardes, Tables, are Lots;
therefore not to be used in sport.</p>

<p><i>Professor.</i> For my better instruction, prove that Lots are
not to be used in sport.</p>

<p><i>Preacher.</i> Consider with regard these three things: First,
that we reade not in the Scriptures that Lots were used, but
only in serious matters, both by the Jewes and Gentiles.
Secondly, that a Lot, in the nature thereof doth as necessarily
suppose the special providence and determining presence of
God, as an oth in the nature thereof doth suppose the testifying
presence of God. Yea, so that, as in an oth, so in a lot,
prayer is expressed, or to bee understoode (I Sam. xiv. 41).
Thirdly, that the proper end of a Lot, as of an oth (Heb.
vi. 16) is to end a controversie: and, therefore, for your
better instruction, examine these reasons. Whatsoever
directly, or of itselfe, or in a speciall manner, tendeth to the
advancing of the name of God, is to be used religiously, and
not to be used in sport, as we are not to pray or sweare in
sport: but the use of Lots, directly of itselfe, and in a speciall
manner, tendeth to the advancing of the name of God, in
attributing to His speciall Providence in the whole and
immediate disposing of the Lot, and expecting the event
(Pro. xvi. 33; Acts i. 24, 26). Therefore the use of Lots
is not to be in sport. Againe, we are not to tempte the
Almightie by a vaine desire of manifestation of his power
and speciall providence (Psal. lxxviii. 18, 19; Esa. vii. 12;
Matth. iv. 6, 7). But, by using Lots in sport, we tempt the
Almighty, vainly desiring the manifestation of his speciall
providence in his immediate disposing. Lastly, whatsoever
God hath sanctified to a proper end, is not to be perverted
to a worse (Matth. xxi. 12, 13). But God hath sanctified
Lots to a proper end, namely to end controversies
(Num. xxvi. 55; Pro. xviii. 18), therefore man is not
to pervert them to a worse, namely to play, and, by playing,
to get away another man’s money, which, without
controversie, is his owne. For the common saying is,
<i>Sine lucro friget lusus</i>, no gaining, cold gaming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Professor.</i> God hath sanctified Psalmes to the praise of his
name, and bread and wine to represent the bodie and bloud
of our crucified Saviour, which be holie ends; and the children
of God may sing Psalmes to make themselves merie in the
Lord, and feede upon bread and wine, not only from necessitie,
but to cheere themselves; why, then, may not God’s
children recreate themselves by lotterie, notwithstanding God
hath sanctified the same to end a controversie?</p>

<p><i>Preacher.</i> Because we finde not in the Scriptures any
dispensation for recreation by lotterie, as we do for godlie
mirth by singing (Jam. v. 13), and for religious and sober
cheering ourselves by eating and drinking (Deut. viii. 9, 10).
And, therefore, (it being withall considered that the ends you
speake of, be not proper, though holy) it followeth, that God
who only disposeth the Lot touching the event, and is,
therefore, a principall actor, is not to bee set on worke by
lotterie in any case, but when hee dispenseth with us, or
gives us leave so to doe. But dispensation for recreation
by lotterie cannot be shewed.</p>

<p><i>Professor.</i> Lots may be used for profit in a matter of
right (Num. xxvi. 55), why not, for pleasure?</p>

<p><i>Preacher.</i> Then othes may be used for pleasure, for they
may for profit, in a matter of truth (Exod. xxii. 8, 11).
But, indeede, lots, (as othes) are not to be used for profit or
pleasure, but only to end a controversie.</p>

<p><i>Professor.</i> The wit is exercised by Tables and Cards, therefore
they be no lots.</p>

<p><i>Preacher.</i> Yet Lotterie is used by casting Dice, and by
shufling and cutting, before the wit is exercised. But how
doth this follow? Because Cards and Tables bee not naked
Lots, consisting only in chance (as Dice) they are, therefore,
no lots at all. Although (being used without cogging, or
packing) they consist principally in chance, from whence
they are to receive denomination. In which respect, a Lot
is called in Latin, <i>Sors</i>, that is, chance or hazard. And
<i>Lyra</i> upon Pro. xvi. saith, To use Lots, is, by a variable
event of some sensible thing, to determine some doubtfull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
or uncertaine matter, as to draw cuts, or to cast Dice. But,
whether you will call Cards and Tables, Lots, or no, you play
with chance, or use Lotterie. Then, consider whether exercise
of wit doth sanctifie playing with lotterie, or playing with
lotterie make such exercising of wit a sinne (Hag. ii. 13, 14).
For as calling God to witness by vaine swearing, is a sinne,
(2 Cor. i. 13) so making God an umpire, by playing with
lotterie, must needs be a sinne; yea, such a sin as maketh
the offender (in some respects) more blame worthie. For
there bee moe occasions of swearing than of lotterie.
Secondly, vaine othes most commonly slip out unawares,
whereas lots cannot be used but with deliberation. Thirdly,
swearing is to satisfie other, whereas this kind of lotterie is
altogether to fulfil our own lusts. Therefore, take heede,
that you be not guiltie of perverting the ordinance of the
Lord, of taking the name of God in vaine, and of tempting
the Almightie, by a gamesome putting off things to hazard,
and making play of lotterie, except you thinke that God
hath no government in vaine actions, or hath dispensed with
such lewd games.</p>

<p><i>Professor.</i> In shooting, there is a chance, by a sudden blast,
yet shooting is no lotterie.</p>

<p><i>Preacher.</i> It is true; for chance commeth by accident,
and not of the nature of the game, to be used.</p>

<p><i>Professor.</i> Lots are secret, and the whole disposing of
them is of God (Pro. xvi. 33); but it is otherwise in tables
and Cards.</p>

<p><i>Preacher.</i> Lots are cast into the lap by man, and that
openly, lest conveiance should be suspected; but the disposing
of the chance is secret, that it may be chance indeed,
and wholly of God, who directeth all things (Prov. xvi. 13,
9, 33). So in Tables, man by faire casting Dice truly made,
and in Cards, by shuffling and cutting, doth openly dispose
the Dice and Cards so, as whereby a variable event may
follow; but it is only and immediately of God that the
Dice bee so cast, and the Cards so shuffled and cut, as that
this or that game followeth, except there be cogging and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
packing. So that, in faire play, man’s wit is not exercised
in disposing the chance, but in making the best of it, being
past.</p>

<p><i>Professor.</i> The end of our play is recreation, and not
to make God an umpire; but recreation (no doubt) is
lawfull.</p>

<p><i>Preacher.</i> It may be the souldiers had no such end when
they cast lots for Christ his coate (Mat. xxvii. 25), but
this should be your end when you use lotterie, as the end
of an oth should be, to call God to witnesse. Therefore, as
swearing, so lotterie, without due respect, is sinne. Againe,
howsoever recreation be your pretended end, yet, remember
that wee must not doe evill that good may come of it
(Rom. iii. 8). And that therefore we are to recreate ourselves
by lawfull recreations. Then see how Cardes and
Tables be lawfull.</p>

<p><i>Professor.</i> If they be not abused by swearing or brawling,
playing for too long time, or too much money.</p>

<p><i>Preacher.</i> Though I am perswaded that it is not lawfull
to play for any money, considering that thankes cannot be
given in faith for that which is so gotten (Deut. xxiii. 18,
Esa. lxi. 8) Gamesters worke not with their hands the
thing that is good, to be free from stealing (Ephe. iv. 28),
and the loser hath not answerable benefit for his money so
lost (Gen. xxix. 15) contrary to that equitie which Aristotle,
by the light of nature hath taught long since; yet I
grant, if Cards and Tables, so used as you speak, be lesse
sinfull, but how they bee lawfull I see not yet.</p>

<p><i>Professor.</i> Good men, and well learned, use them.</p>

<p><i>Preacher.</i> We must live by precept, not by examples,
except they be undoubtedly good. Therefore, examine
whether they bee good and well learned in doing so, or no.
For every man may erre (Ro. iii. 4).</p>

<p><i>Professor.</i> It is not good to be too just, or too wise
(Eccl. vii. 18).</p>

<p><i>Preacher.</i> It is not good to be too wise, or too foolish,
in despising the word of God (Prov. i. 22) and not regarding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the weaknesse of other (Rom. xiv. 21). Let us therefore
beware that we love not pleasure more than godlinesse
(2 Tim. iii. 4).”</p>

<p>The following broadside, which was bought in the streets,
about 1850, is a copy of one which appeared in the newspapers
about the year 1744, when it was entitled “Cards
Spiritualized.” The name of the soldier is there stated to
be one Richard Middleton, who attended divine service, at
a church in Glasgow, with the rest of the regiment.</p>

<h3>“<span class="smcap">The Perpetual Almanack,</span> or <span class="smcap">Soldier’s Prayer
Book.</span></h3>

<p class="pn1">giving an Account of Richard Lane, a Private belonging to
the 47th Regiment of Foot, who was taken before the
Mayor of the Town for Playing at Cards during Divine
Service.</p>

<p>The Sergeant commanded the Soldiers at Church, and
when the Parson had read the prayers, he took his text.
Those who had a Bible, took it out, but the Soldier had
neither Bible nor Common Prayer Book, but, pulling out a
Pack of Cards he spread them before him. He, first, looked
at one card, and then at another: the Sergeant of the
Company saw him, and said, ‘Richard, put up the Cards,
this is not the place for them.’ ‘Never mind that,’ said
Richard. When the service was over, the Constable took
Richard prisoner, and brought him before the Mayor.
‘Well,’ says the Mayor, ‘what have you brought that
Soldier here for?’ ‘For playing Cards in church.’ ‘Well,
Soldier, what have you to say for yourself?’ ‘Much, I
hope, Sir.’ ‘Very good; if not, I will punish you more
than ever man was punished.’ ‘I have been,’ said the
Soldier, ‘about six weeks on the march. I have had but
little to subsist on. I have neither Bible, nor Prayer Book&mdash;I
have nothing but a Pack of Cards, and I hope to satisfy
your Worship of the purity of my intentions.’ ‘Very good,’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
said the Mayor. Then, spreading the cards before the
Mayor, he began with the Ace.</p>

<p>‘When I see the Ace, it reminds me that there is only
one God.</p>

<p>When I see the Deuce, it reminds me of the Father and
the Son.</p>

<p>When I see the Tray, it reminds me of Father, Son and
Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>When I see the Four, it reminds me of the four Evangelists
that preached, viz., Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.</p>

<p>When I see the Five, it reminds me of the Five Wise
Virgins that trimmed their lamps. There were ten, but
five were wise, and five foolish, who were shut out.</p>

<p>When I see the Six, it reminds me that in Six days the
Lord made Heaven and Earth.</p>

<p>When I see the Seven, it reminds me that on the seventh
day God rested from the works which he had made, and
hallowed it.</p>

<p>When I see the Eight, it reminds me of the eight righteous
persons that were saved when God drowned the world,
viz., Noah and his wife, his three sons and their wives.</p>

<p>When I see the Nine, it reminds me of the nine lepers
that were cleansed by our Saviour. There were ten, but
nine never returned God thanks.</p>

<p>When I see the Ten, it reminds me of the Ten Commandments,
which God handed down to Moses, on a table
of stone.</p>

<p>When I see the King, it reminds me of the Great King
of Heaven, which is God Almighty.</p>

<p>When I see the Queen, it reminds me of the Queen of
Sheba, who went to hear the wisdom of Solomon; for she
was as wise a woman as he was a man. She brought with
her fifty boys and fifty girls, all dressed in boy’s apparel
for King Solomon to tell which were boys, and which were
girls. King Solomon sent for water for them to wash
themselves; the girls washed to the elbows, and the boys
only to the wrist, so King Solomon told by that.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Well,’ said the Mayor, ‘you have given a description of
all the Cards in the pack, except one.’ ‘Which is that?’
said the Soldier. ‘The Knave,’ said the Mayor. ‘I will
give your honour a description of that, too, if you will not
be angry.’ ‘I will not,’ said the Mayor, ‘if you will not
term me to be the Knave.’ ‘Well,’ said the Soldier, ‘the
greatest knave I know, is the constable that brought me
here.’ ‘I do not know,’ said the Mayor, ‘whether he is the
greatest knave, but I know he is the greatest fool.’</p>

<p>‘When I count how many spots there are in a pack of
cards, I find 365, as many days as there are in a year.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>When I count the number of cards in a pack, I find there
are 52, as many weeks as there are in a year.</p>

<p>When I count the tricks at Cards, I find 13, as many
months as there are in a year. So you see, Sir, the Pack of
Cards serves for a Bible, Almanack, and Common Prayer
Book to me.’</p>

<p>The Mayor called for some bread and beef for the Soldier,
gave him some money, and told him to go about his business,
saying that he was the cleverest man he ever heard in his
life.”</p>

<p>The origin of Playing Cards is involved in mystery,
although the Chinese claim to have invented them, saying
that the Tien-Tsze, pae, or dotted cards, now in use, were
invented in the reign of Leun-ho, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1120, for the amusement
of his wives; and that they were in common use in
the reign of Kaow-Tsung, who ascended the throne <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1131.
The generally received opinion is that they are of Oriental
extraction, and that they were brought into Europe by the
gipsies, and were first used in Spain. How, or when they
were introduced into England, is not known. In Anstis’s
<i>History of the Order of the Garter</i>, vol. i., p. 307, is to be
found the earliest mention of Cards, if, indeed, the Four
Kings there mentioned are connected with Cards. The
date would be 1278.</p>

<p>“This Enquiry touching the Title of Kings, calls to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
remembrance the Plays forbidden the Clergy, denominated
<i>Ludos de Rege et Regina</i>, which might be <i>Cards</i>, <i>Chesse</i>, or
the Game since used even to this Age at <i>Christmas</i>, called
<i>Questions and Commands</i>, and also that Edward I. plaid <i>ad
quatuor Reges</i> (Wardrobe Rolls, 6 Ed. <span class="smcap">I</span>, <i>Waltero Storton ad
opus Regis ad ludendum ad Quatuor Reges</i> viii. s. v. d.) which
the Collector guesses might be the Game of Cards, wherein
are Kings of the four Suits; for he conceives this Play of
some Antiquity, because the term <i>Knave</i>, representing a
Youth, is given to the next Card in Consequence to the
King and Queen, and is as it were the Son of them, for, in
this Sense this Word, Knave, was heretofore used; thus
<i>Chaucer</i> saith, That <i>Alla</i>, King of <i>Northumberland</i> begot a
Knave Child.”</p>

<p>The Hon. Daines Barrington, in a paper read by him to
the Society of Antiquaries, Feb. 23, 1786, after quoting
Anstis, went on to say that “Edward the First (when
Prince of Wales) served nearly five years in Syria, and,
therefore, whilst military operations were suspended, must,
naturally, have wished for some sedentary amusements.
Now the Asiatics scarcely ever change their customs;
and, as they play at Cards (though, in many respects,
different from ours), it is not improbable that Edward
might have been taught the game, <i>ad quatuor reges</i>, whilst
he continued so long in this part of the globe.</p>

<p>“If, however, this article in the Wardrobe account is not
allowed to allude to <i>playing cards</i>, the next writer who
mentions the more early introduction of them is P. Menestrier,
who, from such another article in the Privy purse
expences of the Kings of France, says they were provided
for Charles VI. by his limner, after that King was deprived
of his senses in 1392. The entry is the following: ‘Donné
a Jacquemin Gringonneur, Peintre, pour <i>trois jeux</i> de Cartes,
a or et a diverses couleurs, de plusieurs devises, pour porter
vers le dit Seigneur Roi pour son abatement, cinquante six
sols Parisis.’”</p>

<p>Still supposing the game of “Four Kings” to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
a game at cards, it seems strange that Chaucer, who was
born fifty years afterwards, should not have made some
mention of Cards as a pastime, for, in his <i>Franklin’s Tale</i>, he
only mentions that “They dancen; and they play at ches
and tables.” The first authentic date we have of playing
Cards in England, shows that they had long been in use in
1463, and were manufactured here, for, by an Act of Parliament
(3 Edward IV. cap. 4), the <i>importation</i> of playing cards
was forbidden.</p>

<p>We get an early notice of cards <i>temp</i> Richard III. in
the Paston letters<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> from Margery Paston to John Paston,
24 Dec. 1484.</p>

<p class="pc1">“<i>To my ryght worschipful husband John Paston.</i></p>

<p class="pn1">Ryght worschipful husbond, I recomaund me onto you.
Plese it you to wete that I sent your eldest sunne to
my Lady Morlee to have Knolage wat sports wer husyd
in her hows in Kyrstemesse next folloyng after the decysse
of my lord, her husbond; and sche seyd that ther wer non
dysgysyngs, ner harpyng, ner syngyn, ner non lowd dysports,
but playing at the tabyllys and schesse and cards.
Sweche dysports sche gave her folkys leve to play and non
odyr.”</p>

<p>Royalty was occasionally given to gambling, and we find
among the private disbursements of Edward the Second
such entries as:</p>

<p>“Item. paid to the King himself, to play at cross and
pile, by the hands of Richard de Meremoth, the receiver of
the Treasury, Twelve pence.</p>

<p>Item. paid there to Henry, the King’s barber, for money
which he lent to the King, to play at cross and pile, Five
shillings.</p>

<p>Item. paid there to Peres Barnard, usher of the King’s
chamber, money which he lent to the King, and which he
lost at cross and pile, to Monsieur Robert Wattewylle, Eight
pence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Item. paid to the King himself, to play at cross and pile,
by Peres Barnard, two shillings, which the said Peres won
of him.”</p>

<p>Also Royalty was fond of playing at cards, which, indeed,
were popular from the highest to the lowest; and we find
that James IV. of Scotland surprised his future bride,
Margaret, sister to Henry VIII., when he paid her his first
visit, playing at cards.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> “The Kynge came privily to the
said castell (of Newbattle) and entred within the chammer
with a small company, where he founde the quene playing
at the cardes.” And in the Privy purse expenses of Elizabeth
of York, queen to Henry VII., we find, under date of
1502: “Item. to the Quenes grace upon the Feest of St
Stephen for hure disporte at cardes this Christmas C.s. (100
shillings).” Whilst to show their popularity in this reign, it
was enacted in 1494 (11 Hen. VII. c. 2), that no artificer
labourer, or servant, shall play at any unlawful game (cards
included) but in Christmas.</p>

<p>Shakespeare makes Henry VIII. play at Cards, for in his
play of that name (Act v. sc. i.) there occurs, “And left
him at Primero with the Duke of Suffolk”; whilst, in the
<i>Merry Wives of Windsor</i> (Act iv. sc. 5), Falstaff says, “I
never prosper’d since I forswore myself at Primero.” Stow
tells us how, in Elizabeth’s time, “from All Hallows eve to
the following Candlemas day, there was, among other sports,
playing at Cards for counters, nails, and points, in every
house, more for pastime than for gain.” When Mary was
Princess, in her Privy Purse expenses there are numerous
entries of money given her wherewith to play at cards.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="beg">Legislation</span> about Cards was thought necessary in Henry
VIII.’s time, for we see in 33 Hen. VIII., cap. 9, sec. xvi.:
“Be it also enacted by the authority aforesaid. That no
manner of artificer, or craftsman of any handicraft or occupation,
husbandman, apprentice, labourer, servant at husbandry,
journeyman, or servant of artificer, mariners, fishermen,
watermen, or any serving man, shall from the said
feast of the Nativity of <i>St John Baptist</i>, play at the tables,
tennis, dice, cards, bowls, clash, coyting, logating, or any
unlawful game, out of <i>Christmas</i>, under the pain of xx s. to
be forfeit for every time,” &amp;c.&mdash;an edict which was somewhat
modified by sec. xxii., which provided “In what cases
servants may play at dice, cards, tables, bowls, or tennis.”</p>

<p>This interference with the amusements of the people did
not lead to good results, as Holinshed tells us (1526): “In
the moneth of Maie was a proclamation made against all
unlawfull games, according to the statute made in this
behalfe, and commissions awarded to every shire for the
execution of the same; so that, in all places, tables, dice,
cards, and bouls were taken and burnt. Wherfore the
people murmured against the cardinall, saieing: that he
grudged at everie man’s plesure, saving his owne. But this
proclamation small time indured. For, when yong men
were forbidden bouls and such other games, some fell to
drinking, some to feretting of other men’s conies, some to
stealing of deere in parks and other unthriftinesse.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>With the exception of the grumbles of the Elizabethan
puritans, such as Stubbes and others, we hear very little of
card playing. Taylor, the “Water Poet,” in his <i>Wit and
Mirth</i> gives a little story anent it, and mentions a game now
forgotten. “An unhappy boy that kept his father’s sheepe
in the country, did use to carry a paire<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> of Cards in his
pocket, and, meeting with boyes as good as himselfe, would
fall to cards at the Cambrian game of whip-her-ginny, or
English One and Thirty; at which sport, hee would some
dayes lose a sheepe or two: for which, if his father corrected
him, hee (in revenge), would drive the sheepe home at night
over a narrow bridge, where some of them falling besides the
bridge, were drowned in the swift brooke. The old man,
being wearied with his ungracious dealing, complained to a
Justice, thinking to affright him from doing any more the
like. In briefe, before the Justice the youth was brought,
where, (using small reverence and lesse manners), the Justice
said to him: Sirrah, you are a notable villaine, you play at
Cards, and lose your father’s sheepe at One and Thirty.
The Boy replied that it was a lye. A lye, quoth the Justice,
you saucy knave, dost thou give me the lye? No, qd
the boy, I gave thee not the lye, but you told me the lye,
for I never lost sheepe at One and Thirty; for, when my
game was one and thirty, I alwayes woune. Indeed, said
the Justice, thou saist true, but I have another accusation
against thee, which is, that you drive your father’s sheepe
over a narrow bridge where some of them are oftentimes
drowned. That’s a lye, too, quoth the boy, for those that go
over the bridge are well enough, it is only those that fall
beside which are drowned: Whereto the Justice said to the
boy’s father, Old man, why hast thou brought in two false
accusations against thy soune, for he never lost sheepe at
one and thirty, nor were there any drowned that went over
the bridge.”</p>

<p>In <i>Taylor’s Motto</i> the same author names many other
games at cards which were then in vogue:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Naturally, under the Puritans, card playing was anathema,
and we hear nothing about it, if we except the political satire
by Henry Nevile, which was published in 1659, the year
after Cromwell’s death. It is entitled “Shuffling, Cutting,
and Dealing in a Game at Picquet: Being acted from the
Year 1653 to 1658 by O. P. [Oliver, Protector] and others,
with great applause. <i>Tempora mutantur et nos.</i>” It is well
worth reading, but it is too long for reproduction here.</p>

<p>But, as soon as the King enjoyed his own again,
dicing and card playing were rampant, as Pepys tells us.
“<i>7 Feb. 1661.</i> Among others Mr Creed and Captain
Ferrers tell me the stories of my Lord Duke of Buckingham’s
and my Lord’s falling out at Havre de Grace, at
Cards; they two and my Lord St Albans playing. The
Duke did, to my Lord’s dishonour, often say that he did, in
his conscience, know the contrary to what he then said, about
the difference at Cards; and so did take up the money that
he should have lost to my Lord, which, my Lord resenting,
said nothing then, but that he doubted not but there were
ways enough to get his money of him. So they parted that
night; and my Lord sent Sir R. Stayner, the next morning, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the Duke, to know whether he did remember what he said
last night, and whether he would owne it with his sword
and a second; which he said he would, and so both sides
agreed. But my Lord St Albans, and the Queen, and
Ambassador Montagu did waylay them at their lodgings
till the difference was made up, to my Lord’s honour; who
hath got great reputation thereby.”</p>

<p>“<i>17 Feb. 1667.</i> This evening, going to the Queene’s
side,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> to see the ladies, I did find the Queene, the Duchesse
of York, and another or two, at cards, with a room full of
great ladies and men, which I was amazed at to see on a
Sunday, having not believed it; but, contrarily, flatly denied
the same, a little while since, to my cousin Roger Pepys.”</p>

<p>“<i>1 Jan. 1668.</i> By and by I met with Mr Brisband;
and having it in my mind this Christmas to do what I
never can remember that I did, go to see the gaming at
the Groome-Porter’s, I, having, in my coming from the
playhouse, stepped into the two Temple halls, and there
saw the dirty prentices and idle people playing, wherein I
was mistaken in thinking to have seen gentlemen of quality
playing there, as I think it was when I was a little child,
that one of my father’s servants, John Bassum, I think,
carried me in his arms thither, where, after staying an hour,
they began to play at about eight at night; where, to see
how differently one man took his losing from another, one
cursing and swearing, and another only muttering and
grumbling to himself, a third without any apparent discontent
at all: to see how the dice will run good luck in
one hand for half an hour together, and on another have no
good luck at all: to see how easily here, where they play
nothing but guinnys, a £100 is won or lost: to see two or
three gentlemen come in there drunk, and, putting their
stock of gold together, one 22 pieces, the second 4, and the
third 5 pieces; and these two play one with another, and
forget how much each of them brought, but he that brought
the 22 thinks that he brought no more than the rest: to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
see the different humours of gamesters to change their luck,
when it is bad, to shift their places, to alter their manner of
throwing, and that with great industry, as if there was anything
in it: to see how some old gamesters, that have no
money now to spend as formerly, do come and sit and look
on, and, among others, Sir Lewes Dives,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> who was here,
and hath been a great gamester in his time: to hear their
cursing and damning to no purpose, as one man being to
throw a seven, if he could; and, failing to do it after a
great many throws, cried he would be damned if ever he
flung seven more while he lived, his despair of throwing it
being so great, while others did it, as their luck served,
almost every throw: to see how persons of the best quality
do here sit down, and play with people of any, though
meaner; and to see how people in ordinary clothes shall
come hither and play away 100, or 2, or 300 guinnys,
without any kind of difficulty; and, lastly, to see the
formality of the groome-porter, who is their judge of all
disputes in play, and all quarrels that may arise therein,
and how his under officers are there to observe true play
at each table and to give new dice, is a consideration I
never could have thought had been in the world had I
not seen it. And mighty glad I am that I did see it, and,
it may be, will find another evening before Christmas be
over, to see it again, when I may stay later, for their heat
of play begins not till about eleven or twelve o’clock;
which did give me another pretty observation of a man
that did win mighty fast when I was there. I think he won
£100 at single pieces in a little time. While all the rest
envied him his good fortune, he cursed it, saying, it come so
early upon me, for this fortune, two hours hence, would be
worth something to me, but then I shall have no such luck.
This kind of prophane, mad entertainment they give themselves.
And so, I, having enough for once, refusing to
venture, though Brisband pressed me hard, and tempted
me with saying that no man was ever known to lose the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
first time, the devil being too cunning to discourage a
gamester, and he offered, also, to lend me 10 pieces to
venture; but I did refuse, and so went away.”</p>

<p>We get a good account of the Gaming-house of this
period in “The Nicker Nicked; or, the Cheats of Gaming
Discovered” (1669), but as it closely resembles Cotton’s
account of an Ordinary, I only give a portion of it.</p>

<p>“If what has been said, will not make you detest this
abominable kind of life; will the almost certain loss of your
money do it? I will undertake to demonstrate that it is ten
to one you shall be a loser at the year’s end, with constant
play upon the square. If, then, twenty persons bring two
hundred pounds a piece, which makes four thousand pounds,
and resolve to play, for example, three or four hours a day
for a year; I will wager the box shall have fifteen hundred
pounds of the money, and that eighteen out of the twenty
persons shall be losers.</p>

<p>“I have seen (in a lower instance) three persons sit down
at Twelvepenny In and In, and each draw forty shillings
a piece; and, in little more than two hours, the box has
had three pounds of the money; and all the three gamesters
have been losers, and laughed at for their indiscretion.</p>

<p>“At an Ordinary, you shall scarce have a night pass without
a quarrel, and you must either tamely put up with an
affront, or else be engaged in a duel next morning, upon
some trifling insignificant occasion, pretended to be a point
of honour.</p>

<p>“Most gamesters begin at small game; and, by degrees, if
their money, or estates, hold out, they rise to great sums;
some have played, first of all, their money, then their rings,
coach and horses, even their wearing clothes and perukes;
and then, such a farm; and, at last, perhaps, a lordship.
You may read, in our histories,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> how Sir Miles Partridge
played at Dice with King Henry the Eighth for Jesus Bells,
so called, which were the greatest in England, and hung in
a tower of St Paul’s Church; and won them; whereby he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
brought them to ring in his pocket; but the ropes, afterwards,
catched about his neck, for, in Edward the Sixth’s
days, he was hanged for some criminal offences.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>“Consider how many people have been ruined by play.
Sir Arthur Smithouse is yet fresh in memory: he had a fair
estate, which in a few years he so lost at play that he died
in great want and penury. Since that Mr Ba&mdash;&mdash;, who was
a Clerk in the Six Clerks Office, and well cliented, fell to
play, and won, by extraordinary fortune, two thousand pieces
in ready gold: was not content with that; played on; lost
all he had won, and almost all his own estate; sold his place
in the office; and, at last marched off to a foreign plantation
to begin a new world with the sweat of his brow. For that
is commonly the destiny of a decayed gamester, either to
go to some foreign plantation, or to be preferred to the
dignity of a box-keeper.</p>

<p>“It is not denied, but most gamesters have, at one time or
other, a considerable run of winning, but, (such is the infatuation
of play) I could never hear of a man that gave over, a
winner, (I mean to give over so as never to play again;) I
am sure it is a <i>rara avis</i>: for if you once ‘break bulk,’ as
they phrase it, you are in again for all. Sir Humphrey
Foster had lost the greatest part of his estate, and then
(playing, it is said, for a dead horse,) did, by happy fortune,
recover it again, then gave over, and wisely too.</p>

<p>“If a man has a competent estate of his own, and plays
whether himself or another man shall have it, it is extreme
folly; if his estate be small, then to hazard the loss even of
that and reduce himself to absolute beggary is direct madness.
Besides, it has been generally observed, that the loss
of one hundred pounds shall do you more prejudice in disquieting
your mind than the gain of two hundred pounds
shall do you good, were you sure to keep it.”</p>

<p>The “Groom Porter” has been more than once mentioned
in these pages. He was formerly an officer of the Lord
Steward’s department of the Royal Household. When the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
office was first appointed is unknown, but Henry Fitzalan,
Earl of Arundel, Lord Chamberlain to Henry VIII. from
1526 to 1530, compiled a book containing the duties of the
officers, in which is set forth “the roome and service belonging
to a groome porter to do.” His business was to see the
King’s lodgings furnished with tables, chairs, stools, firing,
rushes for strewing the floors, to provide cards, dice, &amp;c., and
to decide disputes arising at dice, cards, bowling, &amp;c. The
Groom Porter’s is referred to as a place of excessive play in
the seventeenth year of the reign of Henry VIII. (1526),
when it was directed that the privy chamber shall be “kept
honestly,” and that it “be not used by frequent and intemperate
play, as the Groom Porter’s house.”</p>

<p>Play at Court was lawful, and encouraged, from Christmas
to Epiphany, and this was the Groom Porter’s legitimate
time. When the King felt disposed, and it was his pleasure
to play, it was the etiquette and custom to announce to the
company, that “His Majesty was out”; on which intimation
all Court ceremony and restraint were set aside, and the
sport commenced; and when the Royal Gamester had either
lost, or won, to his heart’s content, notice of the Royal pleasure
to discontinue the game was, with like formality, announced
by intimation that “His Majesty was at home,” whereupon
play forthwith ceased, and the etiquette and ceremony of
the palace was resumed.</p>

<p>The fact of the Christmas gambling is noted in Jonson’s
<i>Alchemist</i>&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppq8 p1">“He will win you,</p>
<p class="ppn4">By irresistible luck, within this fortnight<br />
Enough to buy a barony. This will set him<br />
Upmost at the Groom Porter’s all the Christmas.”</p>

<p class="p1">We saw that Pepys visited the Groom Porter’s at Christmas,
so also did Evelyn.</p>

<p>“<i>6 Jan. 1662.</i> This evening, according to custom, his
Majesty opened the revels of that night, by throwing the
dice himself in the privy chamber, where was a table set on
purpose, and lost his £100. (The year before he won<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
£1500.) The ladies, also, played very deep. I came away
when the Duke of Ormond had won about £1000, and left
them still at passage, cards, &amp;c. At other tables, both there
and at the Groom Porter’s, observing the wicked folly and
monstrous excess of passion amongst some losers: sorry am
I that such a wretched custom as play to that excess should
be countenanced in a Court, which ought to be an example
of virtue to the rest of the kingdom.”</p>

<p>“<i>8 Jan. 1668.</i> I saw deep and prodigious gaming at
the Groom Porter’s, vast heaps of gold squandered away in a
vain and profuse manner. This I looked on as a horrid vice,
and unsuitable to a Christian Court.”</p>

<p>In the reign of James II. the Groom Porter’s was still an
institution, and so it was in William III.’s time, for we read
in <i>The Flying Post</i>, No. 573, Jan. 10-13, 1699. “Friday
last, being Twelf-day, the King, according to custom, plaid
at the Groom Porter’s; where, we hear, Esqre. Frampton<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> was
the greatest gainer.”</p>

<p>In Queen Anne’s time he was still in evidence, as we find
in the <i>London Gazette</i>, December 6-10, 1705. “Whereas Her
Majesty, by her Letters Patent to Thomas Archer, Esqre., constituting
him Her Groom Porter, hath given full power to
him and such Deputies as he shall appoint to supervise,
regulate and authorize (by and under the Rules, Conditions,
and Restrictions by the Law prescribed,) all manner of Gaming
within this Kingdom. And, whereas, several of Her Majesty’s
Subjects, keeping Plays or Games in their Houses, have
been lately abused, and had Moneys extorted from them
by several ill disposed Persons, contrary to Law. These
are, therefore, to give Notice, That no Person whatsoever,
not producing his Authority from the said Groom Porter,
under Seal of his Office, hath any Power to act anything
under the said Patent. And, to the end that all such Persons
offending as aforesaid, may be proceeded against according
to Law, it is hereby desired, that Notice be given of all such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Abuses to the said Groom Porter, or his Deputies, at his Office,
at Mr Stephenson’s, a Scrivener’s House, over against Old
Man’s Coffee House, near Whitehall.”</p>

<p>We get a glimpse of the Groom Porters of this reign in
Mrs Centlivre’s play of <i>The Busy Body</i>:</p>

<p>“<i>Sir Geo. Airy.</i> Oh, I honour Men of the Sword; and I
presume this Gentleman is lately come from Spain or Portugal&mdash;by
his Scars.</p>

<p>“<i>Marplot.</i> No, really, Sir George, mine sprung from civil
Fury: Happening last night into the Groom porter’s&mdash;I had
a strong inclination to go ten Guineas with a sort of a&mdash;sort
of a&mdash;kind of a Milk Sop, as I thought: a Pox of the Dice,
he flung out, and my Pockets being empty, as Charles knows
they sometimes are, he prov’d a Surly North Briton, and
broke my face for my deficiency.”</p>

<p>Both George I. and George the Second played at the Groom
Porter’s at Christmas. In the first number of the <i>Gentleman’s
Magazine</i>, we read how George II. and his Queen spent
their Epiphany. “Wednesday, Jan. 5, 1731. This being
Twelfth Day ... their Majesties, the Prince of Wales, and
the three eldest Princesses, preceded by the Heralds, &amp;c.,
went to the Chapel Royal, and heard divine Service. The
King and Prince made the Offerings at the Altar, of Gold,
Frankincense and Myrrh, according to Custom. At night,
their Majesties &amp;c. play’d at <i>Hazard</i>, for the benefit of the
Groom Porter, and ‘twas said the King won 600 Guineas,
and the Queen 360, Princess Amelia 20, Princess Caroline
10, the Earl of Portmore and the Duke of Grafton, several
thousands.” And we have a similar record in <i>the Grub
Street Journal</i> under date of 7 Jan., 1736. The Office of
Groom Porter was abolished during the reign of George III.
probably in 1772, for in the <i>Annual Register</i> for that year,
under date 6 Jan., it says: “Their Majesties not being
accustomed to play at Hazard, ordered a handsome gratuity
to the Groom Porter; and orders were given, that, for the
future, there be no card playing amongst the servants.”</p>

<p>Card playing was justifiable, and legal, at Christmas.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
An ordinance for governing the household of the Duke of
Clarence, in the reign of Edward IV., forbade all games
at dice, cards, or other hazard for money <i>except during
the twelve days at Christmas</i>. And, again, in the reign of
Henry VII., an Act was passed against unlawful games, which
expressly forbids artificers, labourers, servants, or apprentices
to play at any such, <i>except at Christmas</i>: and, at some of
the Colleges, Cards are introduced into the Combination
Rooms, during the twelve days of Christmas, but never
appear there during the remainder of the year.</p>

<p>Kirchmayer<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> gives a curious custom of gambling in
church on Christmas day:</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“Then comes the day wherein the Lorde</p>
<p class="ppn8">did bring his birth to passe;</p>
<p class="ppn6">Whereas at midnight up they rise,</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="pch">Gambling, early 18th Century&mdash;Mrs Centlivre&mdash;E. Ward&mdash;Steele&mdash;Pope&mdash;Details
of a gaming-house&mdash;Grub St. Journal on Gambling&mdash;Legislation on gambling&mdash;Peeresses
as gaming-house keepers&mdash;A child played for at cards&mdash;Raids
on gaming-houses&mdash;Fielding.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="beg">But</span> to return to the Chronology of Gambling. From the
Restoration of Charles II. to the time of Anne, gambling
was common; but in the reign of this latter monarch, it
either reached a much higher pitch, or else, in that Augustan
Age of Literature, we hear more about it. Any way, we
only know what we read about it. In the epilogue to Mrs
Centlivre’s play of <i>the Gamester</i>, published in 1705, the
audience is thus addressed:</p>

<p class="ppq4 p1">“You Roaring Boys, who know the Midnight Cares<br />
Of Rattling Tatts,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> ye Sons of Hopes and Fears;<br />
Who Labour hard to bring your Ruin on,<br />
And diligently toil to be undone;<br />
You’re Fortune’s sporting Footballs at the best,<br />
Few are his Joys, and small the Gamester’s Rest:<br />
Suppose then, Fortune only rules the Dice,<br />
And on the Square you Play; yet, who that’s Wise<br />
Wou’d to the Credit of a Faithless Main<br />
Trust his good Dad’s hard-gotten hoarded Gain?<br />
But, then, such Vultures round a Table wait,<br />
And, hovering, watch the Bubble’s sickly State;<br />
The young fond Gambler, covetous of more,<br />
Like <i>Esop’s</i> Dog, loses his certain Store.<br />
Then the Spung squeez’d by all, grows dry,&mdash;And, now,<br />
Compleatly Wretched, turns a Sharper too;<br />
These Fools, for want of Bubbles, too, play Fair,<br />
And lose to one another on the Square.</p>

<p class="ptb">·······</p>

<p class="ppn4">This Itch for Play, has, likewise, fatal been,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>And more than <i>Cupid</i>, drawn the Ladies in,<br />
A Thousand Guineas for <i>Basset</i> prevails,<br />
A Bait when Cash runs low, that seldom fails;<br />
And, when the Fair One can’t the Debt defray,<br />
In Sterling Coin, does Sterling Beauty pay.”</p>

<p class="p1">Ward, in a Satire called <i>Adam and Eve stript of their
furbelows</i>, published in 1705, has an Article on the
Gambling lady of the period, entitled, <i>Bad Luck to him
that has her; Or, The Gaming Lady</i>, of which the following
is a portion:</p>

<p>“When an unfortunate Night has happen’d to empty
her Cabinet ... her Jewels are carry’d privately into
<i>Lumbard Street</i>, and Fortune is to be tempted the next
Night with another Sum borrow’d of my Lady’s Goldsmith
at the Extortion of a Pawnbroker; and, if that fails, then she
sells off her Wardrobe, to the great Grief of her Maids;
stretches her Credit amongst those she deals with, pawns
her Honour to her Intimates, or makes her Waiting-Woman
dive into the Bottom of her Trunk, and lug out her green
Net Purse, full of old <i>Jacobus’s</i>, which she has got in her
Time by her Servitude, in Hopes to recover her Losses by a
Turn of Fortune, that she may conceal her bad Luck from the
Knowledge of her Husband: But she is generally such a
Bubble to some Smock fac’d Gamester, who can win her
Money first, carry off the Loser in a Hackney Coach, and
kiss her into a good humour before he parts with her, that
she is generally driven to the last Extremity, and then forc’d
to confess all to her forgiving Spouse, who, either thro’ his
fond Affection, natural Generosity, or Danger of Scandal,
supplies her with Money to redeem her Moveables, buy her
new Apparel, and to pay her Debts upon Honour, that her
Ladyship may be <i>in Statu quo</i>; in which Condition she
never long continues, but repeats the same Game over and
over, to the End of the Chapter: For she is so strangely
infatuated with the Itch of Card Playing, that she makes the
Devil’s Books her very <i>Practice of Piety</i>; and, were she at
her Parish Church, in the Height of her Devotion, should
any Body, in the Interim, but stand at the Church Door, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
hold up the <i>Knave of Clubs</i>, she would take it to be a
Challenge at <i>Lanctre Loo</i>; and, starting from her Prayers,
would follow her beloved <i>Pam</i>, as a deluded Traveller does
an <i>Ignis fatuus</i>.”</p>

<p>No. 120 of <i>the Guardian</i> (July 29, 1713), by Steele, is
devoted to female Gambling as it was in the time of Queen
Anne, and the following is a portion of it:</p>

<p>“Their <i>Passions</i> suffer no less by this Practice than
their Understandings and Imaginations. What Hope and
Fear, Joy and Anger, Sorrow and Discontent break out all at
once in a fair Assembly upon So noble an Occasion as that
of turning up a Card? Who can consider without a Secret
Indignation that all those Affections of the Mind which
should be consecrated to their Children, Husbands and
Parents, are thus vilely prostituted and thrown away upon
a Hand at Loo. For my own part, I cannot but be grieved
when I see a fine Woman fretting and bleeding inwardly
from such trivial Motives; when I behold the Face of an
Angel agitated and discomposed by the Heart of a
Fury.</p>

<p>“Our Minds are of such a Make, that they, naturally,
give themselves up to every Diversion to which they are
much accustomed, and we always find that Play, when
followed with Assiduity, engrosses the whole Woman, She
quickly grows uneasie in her own Family, takes but little
Pleasure in all the domestick, innocent, Endearments of
Life, and grows more fond of <i>Pamm</i> than of her Husband.
My friend <i>Theophrastus</i>, the best of Husbands and of
Fathers, has often complained to me, with Tears in his
Eyes, of the late Hours he is forced to keep, if he would
enjoy his Wife’s Conversation. When she returns to me
with Joy in her Face, it does not arise, says he, from the
Sight of her Husband, but from the good Luck she has had
at Cards. On the contrary, says he, if she has been a Loser,
I am doubly a Sufferer by it. She comes home out of
humour, is angry with every Body, displeased with all I can
do, or say, and, in Reality, for no other Reason but because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
she has been throwing away my Estate. What charming
Bedfellows and Companions for Life, are Men likely to
meet with, that chuse their Wives out of such Women of
Vogue and Fashion? What a Race of Worthies, what
Patriots, what Heroes, must we expect from Mothers of this
Make?</p>

<p>“I come, in the next Place, to consider all the ill Consequences
which Gaming has on the <i>Bodies</i> of our Female
Adventurers. It is so ordered that almost everything which
corrupts the Soul, decays the Body. The Beauties of the
Face and Mind are generally destroyed by the same means.
This Consideration should have a particular Weight with the
Female World, who were designed to please the Eye, and
attract the Regards of the other half of the Species. Now,
there is nothing that wears out a fine Face like the Vigils of
the Card Table, and those cutting Passions which naturally
attend them. Hollow Eyes, haggard Looks, and pale Complexions,
are the natural Indications of a Female Gamester.
Her Morning Sleeps are not able to repair her Midnight
Watchings. I have known a Woman carried off half dead
from <i>Bassette</i>, and have, many a time grieved to see a Person
of Quality gliding by me, in her Chair, at two a Clock
in the Morning, and looking like a Spectre amidst a flare
of Flambeaux. In short, I never knew a thorough paced
Female Gamester hold her Beauty two Winters together.</p>

<p>“But there is still another Case in which the Body is more
endangered than in the former. All Play Debts must be
paid in Specie, or by an Equivalent. The Man who plays
beyond his Income, pawns his Estate; the Woman must
find out something else to Mortgage when her Pin Money
is gone. The Husband has his Lands to dispose of, the
Wife, her Person.”</p>

<p>Almost all writers of the time note and deplore the
gambling propensity of Ladies: and Pope, in his <i>Rape of
the Lock</i> (Canto III.), gives us a picture of a gambling lady,
and a graphic description of the game of <i>Ombre</i>, which was
played in the afternoon:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Things did not improve in the next reign, for Malcolm tells
us, that gaming was dreadfully prevalent in 1718, which might
be demonstrated by the effect of one night’s search by the Leet
Jury of Westminster, who presented no less than thirty-five
houses to the Justices for prosecution. And in the reign of
George II. we have numerous notices of gambling: and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
first number of the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> in 1731 gives for
the information of its readers the following list of officers
established in the most notorious gaming houses:&mdash;</p>

<p>“1. A <i>Commissioner</i>, always a Proprietor, who looks in of
a Night, and the Week’s Accompt is audited by him, and
two others of the Proprietors.&mdash;2. A <i>Director</i>, who superintends
the Room.&mdash;3. An <i>Operator</i>, who deals the Cards at
a cheating Game, called <i>Faro</i>.&mdash;4. Two <i>Crowpees</i>,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> who watch
the Cards, and gather the Money for the Bank.&mdash;5. Two
<i>Puffs</i>, who have Money given them to decoy others to play.&mdash;6.
A <i>Clerk</i>, who is a Check upon the Puffs, to see that
they sink none of the Money that is given them to play
with.&mdash;7. A <i>Squib</i>, is a Puff of a lower Rank, who serves at
half Salary, while he is learning to deal.&mdash;8. A <i>Flasher</i>, to
swear how often the Bank has been stript.&mdash;9. A <i>Dunner</i>,
who goes about to recover Money lost at Play.&mdash;10. A
<i>Waiter</i>, to fill out Wine, snuff Candles, and attend in the
Gaming Room.&mdash;11. An <i>Attorney</i>, a <i>Newgate</i> Solicitor.&mdash;12.
A <i>Captain</i>, who is to fight a Gentleman that is peevish
at losing his money.&mdash;13. An <i>Usher</i>, who lights Gentlemen
up and down Stairs, and gives the Word to the Porter.&mdash;14.
A <i>Porter</i>, who is, generally, a Soldier of the Foot Guards.&mdash;15.
An <i>Orderly Man</i>, who walks up and down the outside
of the Door, to give Notice to the Porter, and alarm the
House, at the Approach of the Constables.&mdash;16. A <i>Runner</i>,
who is to get Intelligence of the Justices meeting.&mdash;17.
<i>Linkboys</i>, <i>Coachmen</i>, <i>Chairmen</i>, <i>Drawers</i>, <i>or others</i>,
who bring the first Intelligence of the Justices Meetings,
or, of the Constables being out, at Half a Guinea Reward.&mdash;18.
<i>Common Bail Affidavit Men</i>, <i>Ruffians</i>, <i>Bravoes</i>,
<i>Assassins</i>, cum multis aliis.”</p>

<p>We have read before (p. 49) of the King’s gambling at
the Groom Porter’s on 5 Jan. 1731, but, to show the fairness
and equality of the law, I will give the very next paragraph:
“At Night (5 Jan.) Mr <i>Sharpless</i>, High Constable
of <i>Holborn</i> Division, with several of his petty Constables,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
searched a notorious Gaming House behind <i>Gray’s Inn
Walks</i>, by Vertue of a Warrant from the Right Hon. Lord
<i>Delawar</i>, and eleven other of his Majesty’s Justices of the
Peace for the County of <i>Middlesex</i>; but the Gamesters,
having previous Notice, they all fled, except the Master
of the House, who was apprehended, and bound in a Recognizance
of £200 penalty, pursuant to the old Statute of
33 Hen. VIII.”</p>

<p>The <i>Grub Street Journal</i> of 28 Dec. 1733, gives a
practical hint how to utilise Gambling: “Dear <i>Bavy</i>.&mdash;As
Gaming is becoming fashionable, and the Increase of the
Poor a general Complaint, I propose to have a Poor’s Box
fix’d up in some convenient Place in every House, which
may contain all Money that shall be won at Cards, or any
other Games; and that a proper Person be appointed in
every Parish to keep the Key, and to collect Weekly from
each House what has been dropt into the Box, in order
to distribute it among the poor, every <i>Sunday</i>. A Friend of
mine, being obliged to play pretty high in a Family, where
he visited, had, generally, Luck on his Side. In some time,
the Master of the Family became extreamly embarrass’d in
the World. My Friend, being acquainted with it, and touch’d
with so moving a Circumstance, went home, and, opening a
Drawer where he had deposited the Winnings brought from
his House, repaid him; thereby, he retrieved his Credit, and
whereby the whole Family was saved from Ruin.&mdash;Yours
&amp;c., <span class="smcap">Jeremy Hint</span>.”</p>

<p>Another letter in the same Journal, 2 Sept. 1736, shows
how the canker of gambling was surely eating into the
very heart of the nation. It is <i>à propos</i> of private Gaming
Houses. “I beg leave, through your Means, to make a few
Remarks upon the great Encrease of a Vice, which, if not
timely prevented, will end in the Ruin of the young and
unwary of both Sexes; I mean, Play in private Houses, and
more particularly that artful and cheating <i>Game</i> of <i>Quadrille</i>.
It is the constant business of the <i>Puffs</i> who belong to the
Gaming Societies, to make a general Acquaintance, and, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
a Volubility of Tongue, to commend Company and Conversation:
to advise young People, or those who have but lately
come to Town, to improve themselves in the <i>Beau Monde</i>.
The young and unwary, thro’ their Inexperience, greedily
swallow this Advice, and deliver themselves up to the Conduct
of these Harpies who swarm in every Corner, where
Visiting is in Fashion: by whom they are introduced into
these polite Families, and taught to lose their Money and
Reputation in a genteel Manner. These Societies consist
mostly of two or three insignificant old Maids, the same
number of gay Widows; a batter’d old Beau or two, who,
in King William’s time, were the Pink of the Mode: The
Master of the House, some decay’d Person of a good
Family, made use of merely as a Cypher to carry on the
Business, by having the Honour to be marry’d to the Lady,
who, to oblige her Friends and People of good Fashion only,
suffers her House to be made use of for these Purposes.
In these places it is that young Ladies of moderate Fortunes
are drawn in, to the infallible Ruin of their Reputations;
and when, by false Cards, Slipping, Signs, and Crimp, they
are stript of their last Guinea, their wretched companions
will not know them. Any one acquainted with the West
End of the Town cannot but have observed all this with
Regret, if they have Honour and Compassion in them. Nor
need I mention the West End only. I believe all Points of
the Compass are infected, and it were to be wished a Remedy
could be found out to prevent it.”</p>

<p>An attempt to remedy this state of things was made,
in 1739, by passing “an Act for the more efficient preventing
of excessive and deceitful gaming” (12 Geo. II. c.
28), which provided that the Person that keeps a house, or
other place, to game in, forfeits £200, half to the prosecutor,
and half to the poor of the parish, except at Bath, where the
half goes to poor in the Hospital. Lotteries, Sales, Shares
in Houses to be determined by Lottery, Raffle, &amp;c., are

in Lotteries, on conviction forfeit £50. The games forbidden
are Ace of Hearts, Faro, Basset and Hazard, except
in Royal Palaces. Justices of Peace refusing to act and
convict on this Act forfeit £10.</p>

<p>But this Act did not go far enough, and it was amended
by the 18 Geo. II. c. 34. The Journals of the House of
Lords have a curious story to tell about this Act.</p>

<p>“<i>Dies Lunæ</i>, <i>29 Aprilis 1745</i>. The House (according
to Order) was adjourned during Pleasure, and put into
Committee upon the Bill intituled ‘An Act to amend,
explain, and make more effectual, the Laws in being, to
prevent excessive and deceitful Gaming: and to restrain
and prevent the excessive Increase of Horse Races.’</p>

<p>After some time the House was resumed.</p>

<p>And the Earl of Warwick reported from the said Committee
that they had gone through the Bill, and made some
Amendments thereto; which he would be ready to report,
when the House will please to receive the same.</p>

<p>Ordered. That the Report be received to-morrow.</p>

<p>The House being informed ‘That Mr Burdus, Chairman
of the Quarter Sessions for the City and Liberty of Westminster,
Sir Thomas de Veil, and Mr Lane, Chairman of
the Quarter Sessions for the County of Middlesex, were at
the door.’</p>

<p>They were called in, and, at the Bar, severally gave an
account that claims of privilege of Peerage were made, and
insisted on, by the Ladies Mordington and Casselis, in order
to intimidate the peace officers from doing their duty in
suppressing the public gaming houses kept by the said
Ladies.</p>

<p>And the said Burdus thereupon delivered in an instrument
in writing, under the hand of the said Lady Mordington,
containing the claim she made of privilege for her
officers and servants employed by her in the said gaming
house.</p>

<p>And then they were directed to withdraw.</p>

<p>And the said Instrument was read, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I, Dame Mary, Baroness of Mordington, do hold a
house in the Great Piazza, Covent Garden, for and as an
Assembly, where all persons of credit are at liberty to
frequent and play at such diversions as are used at other
Assemblys. And I have hired Joseph Dewberry, William
Horsely, Ham Cropper, and George Sanders, as my servants,
or managers, (under me) thereof. I have given them
orders to direct the management of the other inferior
servants, (namely) John Bright, Richard Davis, John Hill,
John Vandenvoren, as box-keepers. Gilbert Richardson,
housekeeper, John Chaplain, regulator, William Stanley and
Henry Huggins, servants that wait on the Company at the
said Assembly, William Penny and Joseph Penny, as porters
thereof. And all the above mentioned persons I claim
as my domestick servants, and demand all those privileges
that belong to me, as a Peeress of Great Britain, appertaining
to my said Assembly. <span class="smcap">M. Mordington.</span> Dated
8 Jan. 1745.’</p>

<p>Resolved and declared that no Person is entitled to
Privilege of Peerage against any prosecution, or proceeding,
for keeping any public or common gaming house, or any
house, room, or place for playing at any game, or games
prohibited by any law now in force.”</p>

<p>These ladies had already been presented by the Grand
Jury for the County of Middlesex on 10 May 1744,
together with the proprietors of the avenues leading to
and from the several Playhouses in Covent Garden and
Drury Lane, the proprietors of Sadler’s Wells, and the proprietors
of New Wells in Goodman’s Fields, The London
Spaw, Clerkenwell, and Halden’s New Theatre, in May
Fair.</p>

<p>One of the most curious anecdotes of gambling, about
this date, is the following<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>:&mdash;“1735. Oct. A child of
James and Elizabeth Leesh of Chester le street, was played
for at cards, at the sign of the Salmon, one game, four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
shillings against the child, by Henry and John Trotter,
Robert Thomson and Thomas Ellison, which was won by
the latter, and delivered to them accordingly.”</p>

<p>The law was occasionally put in motion, as we find.
“<i>Gent. Mag.</i>, Oct. 31, 1750. About 9 o’clock at night, a
party of soldiers and constables, with proper warrants, enter’d
a notorious gaming house, behind the <i>Hoop</i> tavern in the
<i>Strand</i>, and seiz’d 36 gamblers, and carry’d them to the
vestry room at <i>St Martin’s</i>, where the justices were sitting
for that purpose; 21 of them, next morning, for want of
bail, were committed to the <i>Gatehouse</i>, and the others bound
in a recognizance of £80, to answer at the next Sessions;
the fine gaming tables, which cost £200, were chopt to
pieces, and a great part burnt.”</p>

<p>“Feb. 1, 1751. Justice <i>Fielding</i> having received information
of a rendezvous of gamesters in the <i>Strand</i>, procured a
strong party of guards, who seized 45 at the table, which they
broke to pieces, and carry’d the gamesters before the justice,
who committed 39 of them to the <i>Gatehouse</i> and admitted
the other 6 to bail. There were three tables broken to
pieces, which cost near £60 apiece; under each of them
were observed two iron rollers, and two private springs,
which those who were in the secret could touch, and stop
the turning whenever they had any youngsters to deal with,
and, so, cheated them of their money.”</p>

<p>“Ap. 17, 1751. <i>Thomas Lediard</i>, Esq., attended by a
constable and a party of guards, went this night to the
Long Room, in James St., Westminster, where there was a
Masquerade, in order to suppress the notorious practice of
gaming, for which such assemblies are calculated. The
whole was conducted without opposition, or mischief.
Seventeen were committed to the gatehouse, some were
discharged, and others gave sufficient bail, never to play at
any unlawful game, or resort to any gaming house. Numbers
escaped over the Park wall, and other places, notwithstanding
the vigilance of the magistrate and his assistants.
The gaming tables were broke to pieces.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>We have many instances of the industry and vigilance
of the London magistrates, especially Fielding, who, in
1756, wrote a warning to the public,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> entitled “The artifices
and stratagems of the profligate and wicked part of the
inhabitants of this great metropolis, in order to defraud and
impose upon the weak and unwary, being multiplied to an
incredible degree, <i>Mr Fielding</i> has taken the pains to lay
before the public a detail of such of them as have fallen
under his own immediate observation as a Magistrate: in
the recital of which he has mark’d the progress of deceit
from the lowest pickpocket to the most accomplish’d
gambler. That none may be in ignorance of the snares
that are continually laid for them, this history of Gambling
is inserted.” And in <i>Ferdinand Count Fathom</i>, by Smollett,
Fielding’s contemporary and brother novelist, we have a full
description of a professional gambler’s life.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="pch">Gambling at Bath&mdash;Beau Nash&mdash;Anecdotes of him&mdash;A lady gambler&mdash;Horace
Walpole’s gossip about gambling&mdash;Awful story about Richard Parsons&mdash;Gambling
anecdotes&mdash;C. J. Fox.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="beg">Nor</span> was it only in London that this gambling fever existed:
it equally polluted the quieter resorts of men, and at fashionable
watering places, like Bath, it was rampant, as Oliver
Goldsmith writes in his life of Beau Nash, of whom he tells
several anecdotes connected with play. “When he first
figured at <i>Bath</i>, there were few laws against this destructive
amusement. The gaming table was the constant resource
of despair and indigence, and the frequent ruin of opulent
fortunes. Wherever people of fashion came, needy adventurers
were generally found in waiting. With such Bath
swarmed, and, among this class, Mr Nash was certainly to
be numbered in the beginning; only, with this difference,
that he wanted the corrupt heart, too commonly attending
a life of expedients; for he was generous, humane, and
honourable, even though, by profession, a gambler.”</p>

<p>A thousand instances might be given of his integrity, even
in this infamous profession, where his generosity often impelled
him to act in contradiction to his interest. Wherever
he found a novice in the hands of a sharper, he generally
forewarned him of the danger; whenever he found any
inclined to play, yet ignorant of the game, he would offer
his services, and play for them. I remember an instance to
this effect, though too nearly concerned in the affair to publish
the gentleman’s name of whom it is related.</p>

<p>In the year 1725, there came to Bath a giddy youth, who
had just resigned his fellowship at Oxford. He brought his
whole fortune with him there; it was but a trifle, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
he was resolved to venture it all. Good fortune seemed
kinder than could be expected. Without the smallest skill
in play, he won a sum sufficient to make any unambitious
man happy. His desire of gain increasing with his gains,
in the October following he was <i>at all</i>, and added four
thousand pounds to his former capital. Mr Nash, one night,
after losing a considerable sum to this undeserving son of
fortune, invited him to supper. Sir, cried this honest, though
veteran gamester, perhaps you may imagine I have invited
you, in order to have my revenge at home; but, sir, I scorn
such an inhospitable action. I desired the favour of your
company to give you some advice, which, you will pardon
me, sir, you seem to stand in need of. You are now high
in spirits, and drawn away by a torrent of success. But,
there will come a time, when you will repent having left the
calm of a college life for the turbulent profession of a
gamester. Ill runs will come, as certain as day and night
succeed each other. Be therefore advised; remain content
with your present gains; for, be persuaded that, had you the
Bank of England, with your present ignorance of gaming, it
would vanish like a fairy dream. You are a stranger to me;
but, to convince you of the part I take in your welfare, I’ll
give you fifty guineas, to forfeit twenty, every time you lose
two hundred at one sitting. The young gentleman refused
his offer, and was at last undone!</p>

<p>“The late Duke of B. being chagrined at losing a considerable
sum, pressed Mr Nash to tie him up for the future
from playing deep. Accordingly, the beau gave his grace
an hundred guineas, to forfeit ten thousand, whenever he lost
a sum, to the same amount, at play at one sitting. The
duke loved play to distraction; and, soon after, at hazard,
lost eight thousand guineas, and was going to throw for
three thousand more, when Nash, catching hold of the dice
box, entreated his grace to reflect upon the penalty if he lost.
The duke, for that time, desisted; but so strong was the furor
of play upon him that, soon after losing a considerable sum
at Newmarket, he was contented to pay the penalty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“When the late Earl of T&mdash;&mdash; d was a youth, he was passionately
fond of play, and never better pleased than with
having Mr Nash for his antagonist. Nash saw, with concern,
his lordship’s foible, and undertook to cure him, though
by a very disagreeable remedy. Conscious of his own
superior skill, he determined to engage him in single play
for a very considerable sum. His lordship, in proportion as
he lost his game, lost his temper, too; and, as he approached
the gulph, seemed still more eager for ruin. He lost his
estate; some writings were put into the winner’s possession:
his very equipage deposited as a last stake, and he lost that
also. But, when our generous gamester had found his lordship
sufficiently punished for his temerity, he returned all,
only stipulating that he should be paid five thousand pounds
whenever he should think proper to make the demand.
However, he never made any such demand during his lordship’s
life; but, some time after his decease, Mr Nash’s
affairs being in the wane, he demanded the money of his
lordship’s heirs, who honourably paid it without any
hesitation.”</p>

<p>There is a sad story told of a lady gambler at Bath, which
must have occurred about this time, say 1750 or thereabouts.
Miss Frances Braddock, daughter of a distinguished officer,
Maj.-Gen. Braddock, was the admiration of the circle in which
she moved. Her person was elegant, her face beautiful, and
her mind accomplished. Unhappily for her, she spent a
season at Bath, where she was courted by the fashionables
there present, for her taste was admirable and her wit
brilliant. Her father, at his death, bequeathed twelve
thousand pounds between her and her sister (a large
amount in those days), besides a considerable sum to her
brother, Maj.-Gen. Braddock, who was, in the American
War, surrounded by Indians, and mortally wounded,
dying 13th July 1755. Four years after her father’s
death, her sister died, by which her fortune was doubled&mdash;but,
alas! in the course of one short month, she lost
the whole; gambled away at cards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>It soon became known that she was penniless, and her
sensitive spirit being unable to brook the real and fictitious
condolences, she robed herself in maiden white, and, tying a
gold and silver girdle together, she hanged herself therewith,
dying at the early age of twenty-three years.</p>

<p>Gossiping Horace Walpole gives us many anecdotes of
gambling in his time, scattered among his letters to Sir
Horace Mann, &amp;c. In one of them (Dec. 26, 1748), he
tells a story of Sir William Burdett, of whom he says;
“in short, to give you his character at once, there is a wager
entered in the bet book at White’s (a MS. of which I may,
one day or other, give you an account), that the first baronet
that will be hanged, is this Sir William Burdett.”</p>

<p>The Baronet casually met Lord Castledurrow (afterwards
Viscount Ashbrook), and Captain (afterwards Lord) Rodney,
“a young seaman, who has made a fortune by very gallant
behaviour during the war,” and he asked them to
dinner.</p>

<p>“When they came, he presented them to a lady, dressed
foreign, as a princess of the house of Brandenburg: she had
a toad eater, and there was another man, who gave himself
for a count. After dinner, Sir William looked at his watch,
and said ‘J&mdash;&mdash; s! it is not so late as I thought, by an hour;
Princess, will your Highness say how we shall divert ourselves
till it is time to go to the play! ‘Oh!’ said she, ‘for
my part, you know I abominate everything but Pharaoh.’
‘I am very sorry, Madam,’ replied he, very gravely, ‘but I
don’t know whom your Highness will get to tally to you;
you know I am ruined by dealing.’ ‘Oh!’ says she, ‘the
Count will deal to us.’ ‘I would, with all my soul,’ said
the Count, ‘but I protest I have no money about me.’ She
insisted: at last the Count said, ‘Since your Highness
commands us peremptorily, I believe Sir William has four
or five hundred pounds of mine, that I am to pay away in
the city to-morrow; if he will be so good as to step to his
bureau for that sum, I will make a bank of it.’ Mr Rodney
owns he was a little astonished at seeing the Count shuffle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
with the faces of the cards upwards; but, concluding that
Sir William Burdett, at whose house he was, was a relation,
or particular friend of Lord Castledurrow, he was unwilling
to affront my lord. In short, my lord and he lost about a
hundred and fifty apiece, and it was settled that they should
meet for payment, the next morning, at Ranelagh. In the
meantime, Lord C. had the curiosity to inquire a little into
the character of his new friend, the Baronet; and being <i>au
fait</i>, he went up to him at Ranelagh, and apostrophised him;
‘Sir William, here is the sum I think I lost last night; since
that, I have heard that you are a professed pickpocket, and,
therefore, desire to have no farther acquaintance with you.’
Sir William bowed, took the money and no notice; but, as
they were going away, he followed Lord Castledurrow, and
said, ‘Good God! my lord, my equipage is not come; will
you be so good as to set me down at Buckingham Gate?’
and, without waiting for an answer, whipped into the chariot,
and came to town with him. If you don’t admire the coolness
of this impudence, I shall wonder.”</p>

<p>“<i>10 Jan. 1750.</i> To make up for my long silence, and
to make up a long letter, I will string another story, which I
have just heard, to this. General Wade was at a low gaming
house, and had a very fine snuff-box, which, on a sudden, he
missed. Everybody denied having taken it: he insisted on
searching the company. He did: there remained only one
man, who had stood behind him, but refused to be searched,
unless the General would go into another room, alone, with
him. There the man told him, that he was born a gentleman,
was reduced, and lived by what little bets he could pick
up there, and by fragments which the waiters sometimes gave
him. ‘At this moment I have half a fowl in my pocket; I
was afraid of being exposed; here it is! Now, Sir, you may
search me.’ Wade was so struck, that he gave the man a
hundred pounds; and, immediately, the genius of generosity,
whose province is almost a sinecure, was very glad of the
opportunity of making him find his own snuff-box, or another
very like it, in his own pocket again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i>19 Dec. 1750.</i> Poor Lord Lempster is more Cerberus<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
than ever; (you remember his <i>bon mot</i> that proved such a
blunder;) he has lost twelve thousand pounds at hazard, to
an ensign of the guards.”</p>

<p>“<i>23 Feb. 1755.</i> The great event is the catastrophe of
Sir John Bland, who has <i>flirted</i> away his whole fortune at
hazard. He, t’other night, exceeded what was lost by the
late Duke of Bedford, having, at one period of the night,
(though he recovered the greatest part of it) lost two and
thirty thousand pounds. The citizens put on their double
channeled pumps, and trudge to St James’s Street, in
expectation of seeing judgments executed on White’s&mdash;angels
with flaming swords, and devils flying away with
dice boxes, like the prints in Sadeler’s Hermits.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Sir
John lost this immense sum to a Captain Scott,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> who,
at present, has nothing but a few debts and his commission.”</p>

<p>“<i>20 Ap. 1756.</i> I shall send you, soon, the fruits of my
last party to Strawberry; Dick Edgecumbe, George Selwyn,
and Williams were with me; we composed a coat of arms
for the two clubs at White’s, which is actually engraving
from a very pretty painting of Edgecumbe,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> whom Mr Chute,

<p>“<i>14 May 1761.</i> Jemmy Lumley, last week, had a party
of whist at his own house; the combatants, Lucy Southwell,
that curtseys like a bear, Mrs Prijeau, and a Mrs Mackenzie.
They played from six in the evening till twelve the next
day; Jemmy never winning one rubber, and rising a loser
of two thousand pounds. How it happened, I know not,
nor why his suspicions arrived so late, but he fancied himself
cheated, and refused to pay. However, <i>the bear</i> had no
share in his evil surmises: on the contrary, a day or two
afterwards, he promised a dinner at Hampstead to Lucy and
her virtuous sister. As he went to the rendezvous, his chaise
was stopped by somebody, who advised him not to proceed.
Yet, no whit daunted, he advanced. In the garden, he
found the gentle conqueress, Mrs Mackenzie, who accosted
him in the most friendly manner. After a few compliments,
she asked him if he did not intend to pay her. ‘No, indeed
I shan’t, I shan’t; your servant, your servant.’ ‘Shan’t you,’
said the fair virago; and, taking a horsewhip from beneath
her hoop, she fell upon him with as much vehemence as the
Empress Queen would upon the King of Prussia, if she could
catch him alone in the garden at Hampstead. Jemmy cried
out Murder; his servants rushed in, rescued him from the
jaws of the lioness, and carried him off in his chaise to town.
The Southwells, who were already arrived, and descended,
on the noise of the fray, finding nobody to pay for the
dinner, and fearing they must, set out for London without
it.”</p>

<p>“<i>3 Dec. 1761.</i> If you are acquainted with my Lady
Barrymore, pray tell her that, in less than two hours, t’other
night, the Duke of Cumberland lost four hundred and fifty
pounds at Loo; Miss Pelham won three hundred, and I, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
rest. However, in general, Loo is extremely gone to decay:
I am to play at Princess Emily’s to-morrow, for the first time
this winter; and it is with difficulty that she has made a
party.”</p>

<p>“<i>2 Feb. 1770.</i> The gaming at Almack’s, which has taken
the <i>pas</i> of White’s, is worthy of the decline of our Empire, or
Commonwealth, which you please. The young men of the
age lose five, ten, fifteen thousands pounds in an evening
there. Lord Stavordale, not one and twenty, lost eleven
thousand there, last Tuesday, but recovered it by one great
hand at hazard: he swore a great oath,&mdash;‘Now, if I had
been playing <i>deep</i>, I might have won millions.’ His cousin,
Charles Fox, shines equally there, and in the House of
Commons.”</p>

<p>“<i>18 Aug. 1776.</i> To-day I have heard the shocking
news of Mr Damer’s death, who shot himself yesterday, at
three o’clock in the morning, at a tavern in Covent Garden.
My first alarm was for Mr Conway; not knowing what
effect such a horrid surprise would have on him, scarce recovered
from an attack himself; happily, it proves his nerves
were not affected, for I have had a very calm letter from
him on the occasion. Mr Charles Fox, with infinite good
nature, met Mrs Damer coming to town, and stopped her to
prepare her for the dismal event. It is almost impossible to
refrain from bursting into commonplace reflections on this
occasion; but, can the walls of Almack’s help moralizing,
when £5000 a year, in present, and £22,000 in reversion,
are not sufficient for happiness, and cannot check a pistol!”</p>

<p>“<i>19 Jan. 1777.</i> Lord Dillon told me this morning
that Lord Besborough and he, playing at quinze t’other
night with Miss Pelham, and, happening to laugh, she flew
in a passion and said, ‘It was terrible to play with <i>boys</i>!’
And our two ages together, said Lord Dillon, make up
above a hundred and forty.”</p>

<p>“<i>6 Feb. 1780.</i> Within this week there has been a cast
at hazard at the Cocoa Tree, the difference of which
amounted to a hundred and four score thousand pounds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Mr O’Birne, an Irish gamester, had won one hundred thousand
pounds of a young Mr Harvey, of Chigwell, just started
from a midshipman<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> into an estate, by his elder brother’s
death. O’Birne said, ‘You never can pay me.’ ‘I can,’
said the youth; my estate will sell for the debt.’ ‘No,’ said
O., ‘I will win ten thousand&mdash;you shall throw for the odd
ninety.’ They did, and Harvey won.”</p>

<p>“<i>29 Jan. 1791.</i> Pray delight in the following story:
Caroline Vernon, <i>fille d’honneur</i>, lost, t’other night, two
hundred pounds at faro, and bade Martindale mark it up.
He said he would rather have a draft on her banker. ‘Oh!
willingly’; and she gave him one. Next morning, he
hurried to Drummond’s, lest all her money should be drawn
out. ‘Sir,’ said the clerk, ‘would you receive the contents
immediately?’ ‘Assuredly.’ ‘Why, sir, have you read the
note?’ Martindale took it; it was, ‘Pay the bearer two
hundred blows, well applied.’ The nymph tells the story
herself; and, yet, I think, the clerk had the more humour of
the two.”</p>

<p>There can be no doubt but that in the last half of the
eighteenth century, gambling for large sums was very rife.
We have evidence of it on all hands.</p>

<p>“<i>Ann. Reg.</i>, <i>8 Feb. 1766</i>. We are informed that a lady,
at the West end of the town, lost, one night, at a sitting,
3000 guineas at Loo.”</p>

<p><i>Par parenthèse</i>, the same volume has (p. 191) the following
horrible story: “<i>A circumstantial and authentic account
of the miserable case of Richard Parsons, as transmitted in a
letter from William Dallaway, Esq., High Sheriff of Gloucestershire,
to his friend in London</i>.</p>

<p>“On the 20th of February last, Richard Parsons, and three
more men met at a private house at Chalford, in order to
play at cards, about six o’clock in the evening. They played
at loo till about eleven or twelve that night, when they
changed their game to whist: after a few deals, a dispute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
arose about the state of the game. Parsons affirmed, with
oaths, that they were six, which the others denied, upon
which he wished ‘that he might never enter the kingdom of
heaven, that his flesh might rot upon his bones, if they were
not six in the game.’ These wishes were several times repeated,
both then and afterwards. Upon this, the candle
was put out by one James Young, a stander by, who says he
was shocked with the oaths and expressions he heard; and
that he put out the candle with a design to put an end to
the game.</p>

<p>“Presently, upon this, they adjourned to another house, and
there began a fresh game, when Parsons and his partner had
great success. Then they played at loo again till four in the
morning. During this second playing, Parson complained to
one Rolles, his partner, of a bad pain in his leg, which, from
that time, increased. There was an appearance of a swelling,
and, afterwards, the colour changing to that of a mortified
state. On the following Sunday, he rode to Minchin Hampton,
to get the advice of Mr Pegler, the surgeon in that
town, who attended him from the Thursday after February
27. Notwithstanding all the applications that were made,
the mortification increased, and showed itself in different
parts of the body. On Monday, March 3, at the request of
some of his female relations, the clergyman of Bisley attended
him, and administered the sacrament, without any
knowledge of what had happened before, and which he continued
a stranger to, till he saw the account in the <i>Gloucester
Journal</i>. Parsons appeared to be extremely ignorant of
religion, having been accustomed to swear, to drink (though
he was not in liquor when he uttered the above execrable
wish), to game, and to profane the Sabbath, though he was
only in his nineteenth year. After he had received the
Sacrament, he appeared to have some sense of the ordinance;
for he said, ‘Now I must never sin again; he hoped
God would forgive him, having been wicked not above six
years, and that, whatsoever should happen, he would not
play at cards again.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>“After this, he was in great agony, chiefly delirious, spoke
of his companions by name, and seemed as if his imagination
was engaged at cards. He started, had distracted looks and
gestures, and, in a dreadful fit of shaking and trembling,
died on Tuesday morning, the 4th of March last: and was
buried the next day at the parish church of Bisley. His
eyes were open when he died, and could not be closed by the
common methods; so that they remained open when he
was put into the coffin. From this circumstance arose a
report, that he <i>wished his eyes might never close</i>; but this
was a mistake; for, from the most creditable witnesses, I
am fully convinced that no such wish was uttered; and the
fact is, that he did close his eyes after he was taken with the
mortification, and either dozed or slept several times.</p>

<p>“When the body came to be laid out, it appeared all over
discoloured, or spotted; and it might be said, in the most
literal sense, that his flesh rotted on his bones before he
died.”</p>

<p>But this is a digression. Among the deaths recorded in
the <i>Gents’ Magazine</i> for 1776, is “Ap. 30. William G&mdash;&mdash;,
Esq.: who, having been left £18,000, a few months before,
by his father, lost it all by gaming, in less than a month;
in the Rules of the King’s Bench.”</p>

<p>“<i>Oct. 25, 1777.</i> At the Sessions for the County of
Norfolk, a tradesman of Norwich, for cheating at cards,
was fined £20, and sentenced to suffer six months’
imprisonment in the castle, without bail or main prize;
and, in case the said fine was not paid at the expiration of
the term, then to stand on the pillory, one hour, with his
ears nailed to the same.”</p>

<p>The gamblers of those days were giants in their way,
there were George Selwyn, Lord Carlisle, Stephen Fox,
who, on one occasion was fleeced most unmercifully at a
West-end gambling house. He went into it with £13,000,
and left without a farthing. His younger brother, Charles
James, was a notorious gambler, and, if the following anecdote
is true, not over honourable. He ranked among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
admirers of Mrs Crewe. A gentleman lost a considerable
sum to this lady at play, and, being obliged to leave town
suddenly, gave Mr Fox the money to pay her, begging him
to apologise to the lady for his not having paid the debt of
honour in person. Fox, unfortunately, lost every shilling of
it before morning. Mrs Crewe often met the supposed
debtor afterwards, and, surprised that he never noticed the
circumstance, at length, delicately hinted the matter to him.
“Bless me,” said he, “I paid the money to Mr Fox three
months ago.” “Oh! did you, Sir?” said Mrs Crewe, good-naturedly,
“then probably he paid me, and I forgot it.”</p>

<p>Steinmetz<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> (vol. i., p. 323) says: “Fox’s best friends are
said to have been half-ruined in annuities given by them as
securities for him to the Jews. £500,000 a year of such
annuities of Fox and his ‘society’ were advertised to be sold
at one time. Walpole wondered what Fox would do when
he had sold the estates of his friends. Walpole further notes
that, in the debate on the Thirty-nine Articles, Feb. 6,
1772, Fox did not shine; nor could it be wondered at.
He had sat up playing at hazard, at Almack’s, from Tuesday
evening, the 4th, till five in the afternoon of Wednesday,
the 5th. An hour before, he had recovered £12,000 that
he had lost; and by dinner, which was at five o’clock, he
had ended, losing £11,000! On the Thursday, he spoke in
the above debate; went to dinner at half-past eleven, at
night; from thence to White’s, where he drank till seven the
next morning; thence to Almack’s, where he won £6000;
and, between three and four in the afternoon, he set out for
Newmarket. His brother Stephen lost £11,000 two nights
after, and Charles £10,000 more on the 13th, so that in
three nights the two brothers&mdash;the eldest not <i>twenty-five</i>
years of age&mdash;lost £32,000!”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="pch">The Gambling ladies&mdash;Ladies Archer, Buckinghamshire, Mrs Concannon, &amp;c.&mdash;Private
Faro Banks&mdash;Card-money&mdash;Gaming House end of Eighteenth
Century&mdash;Anecdotes&mdash;The profits of Gaming Houses&mdash;C. J. Fox and Sir
John Lade&mdash;Col. Hanger on gambling.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="beg">We</span> have previously read how ladies of position kept
gambling houses, and pleaded their privilege to do so;
they, however, had to bow to the law. In the latter part
of the eighteenth century many ladies opened their houses,
the best known, probably, being Lady Buckinghamshire and
Lady Archer. The former is said to have slept with a
blunderbuss and a pair of pistols by her bedside, to protect
her Faro bank; and the latter was notorious for her “make
up,” as we may see by the two following notices in the
<i>Morning Post</i>.</p>

<p>“<i>Jan. 5, 1789.</i> The Lady Archer, whose death was announced
in this paper of Saturday, is not the celebrated
character whose <i>cosmetic powers</i> have long been held in
public estimation.”</p>

<p>“<i>Jan. 8, 1789.</i> It is said that the dealers in <i>Carmine
and dead white</i>, as well as the <i>perfumers</i> in general, have it
in contemplation to present an Address to Lady Archer, in
gratitude for her not having <span class="smcap">DIED</span> according to a late
alarming report.”</p>

<p>We get portraits of these two ladies in a satirical print by
Gillray (31st March 1792), which is entitled “Modern Hospitality,
or a Friendly Party in High Life,” where they are
shewn keeping a Faro bank; and as these fair ones were
then somewhat <i>passées</i>, the picture has the following:&mdash;“To
those earthly Divinities who charmed twenty years ago, this
Honourable method of banishing mortifying reflections is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
dedicated. O, Woman! Woman! everlasting is your power
over us, for in youth you charm away our hearts, and, in
your after years, you charm away our purses!” The players
are easily recognised. Lady Archer, who sits on the extreme
left, has won largely; rouleaux of gold and bank notes are
before her, and, on her right hand, are two heaps of loose
gold: and the painted old gambler smiles as she shows her
cards, saying, “The Knave wins all!” Her next-door
neighbour, the Prince of Wales, who has staked and lost his
last piece, lifts his hands and eyes in astonishment at the
luck. Lady Buckinghamshire has doubled her stake, playing
on two cards, and is, evidently, annoyed at her loss, while
poor, black-muzzled Fox laments the loss of his last three
pieces.</p>

<p>Gillray portrayed these two ladies on several occasions.
There are two pictures of St James’s and St Giles’s, and in
“Dividing the Spoil, St James’s, 1796,” we see Lady Archer
and Lady Buckinghamshire quarrelling over gold, bank
notes, a sword, and an order. One other lady, probably
Lady Mount Edgecumbe, is scrutinising a bill, whilst a
fourth, with a pile of gold and notes before her, looks on
smilingly.</p>

<p>Another print (16th May 1796) is called “Faro’s Daughters,
or the Kenyonian Blow Up to Gamblers.” Here we see
Lady Archer and Mrs Concannon placed together in the
pillory, where they are mutually upbraiding each other. The
<i>motif</i> for this picture was a speech of Lord Kenyon’s, who, at
a trial to recover £15, won at gaming on Sunday, at a public-house,
commented very severely on the hold the vice of gaming
had on all classes of society, from the highest to the
lowest. The former, he said, set the example to the latter,
and, he added, “They think they are too great for the law;
I wish they could be punished”&mdash;and then continued, “If
any prosecutions of this kind are fairly brought before me,
and the parties are justly convicted, whatever be their rank
or station in the country, though they be the first ladies in
the land, they shall certainly exhibit themselves in the pillory.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>They were getting somewhat too notorious. In spite of
Lady Buckinghamshire’s precautions of blunderbuss and
pistols, her croupier, Martindale, announced, on 30th Jan.
1797, that the box containing the cash of the Faro bank
had unaccountably disappeared. All eyes were turned
towards her ladyship. Mrs Concannon said she once lost a
gold snuff-box from the table when she went to speak to
Lord C. Another lady said she lost her purse there
the previous winter, and a story was told that a certain lady
had taken <i>by mistake</i> a cloak which did not belong to her at
a rout given by the late Countess of Guildford. Unfortunately,
a discovery was made, and when the servant knocked
at the door to demand it, some very valuable lace with which
it was trimmed had been taken off. Some surmised that
the lady who stole the cloak might also have stolen the Faro
bank.</p>

<p>Townsend and his meddlesome police would poke their
noses into the business, and, although they did not recover
the Faro bank, something did come out of their interference,
as we read in the <i>Times</i> of 13th March 1797. “<span class="smcap">Public
Office, Marlborough Street.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Faro Banks.</span>&mdash;On
Saturday came on to be heard informations against Lady
Buckinghamshire, Lady Elizabeth Luttrell, Mrs Sturt, and
Mr Concannon, for having, on the night of the 30th of last
January, played at <i>Faro</i>, at Lady Buckinghamshire’s house,
in St James’s Square, and Mr Martindale was charged with
being the proprietor of the table.</p>

<p>“The evidence went to prove that the defendants had
gaming parties at their different houses in rotation; and,
that when they met at Lady B.’s, the witnesses used to wait
upon them in the gambling room, and that they played at
<i>E. O.</i>, <i>Rouge et Noir</i>, &amp;c., from about eleven or twelve till
three or four o’clock in the morning. After hearing counsel
the Magistrates convicted <i>Henry Martindale</i> in the penalty
of £200, and <i>each of the ladies</i> in £50. The information
against Mr Concannon was quashed, on account of his being
summoned by a wrong Christian name.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Gillray improved this occasion, giving us “Discipline à la
Kenyon,” and drew Lady Buckinghamshire tied to the tail
of a cart, on which is a placard, “<span class="smcap">Faro’s Daughters
Beware</span>”: the Lord Chief Justice is depicted as administering
a sound flogging both with birch and cat-o’-nine-tails
to the delinquent lady, whilst Lady Luttrell and Mrs Sturt
stand in the pillory guarded by a stalwart constable.</p>

<p>These ladies do not seem to have survived the century,
for the <i>Morning Post</i> of Jan. 12, 1800, says: “Society has
reason to rejoice in the complete downfall of the Faro
Dames, who were so long the disgrace of human nature.
Their <i>die</i> is cast, and their <i>odd tricks</i> avail no longer. The
<i>game</i> is up, and very few of them have <i>cut</i> with <i>honours</i>.”
Mrs Concannon still kept on, but not in London, as is seen
by the following paragraph. <i>Morning Herald</i>, 18th Dec.
1802: “The visitors to Mrs Concannon’s <i>petits soupers</i> at
<i>Paris</i>, are not attracted by <i>billets</i> previously circulated, but
by <i>cards</i>, afterwards <i>dealt out</i> in an elegant and scientific
manner; not to mince the matter, they are the rendezvous
of <i>deep play</i>: and the only questionable point about the
matter is, whether the <i>Irish</i> or the <i>French</i> will prove victors
at the close of so desperate a winter’s campaign.”</p>

<p>The following extracts from <i>The Times</i> tell us much
about the fashionable professional lady gamblers:&mdash;</p>

<p>“<i>Feb. 5, 1793.</i> Mrs Sturt’s house in St James Square
was opened yesterday evening, for the first time this season,
for public play. The visitors were numerous.”</p>

<p>“<i>Feb. 6, 1793.</i> Some of the <i>Faro ladies</i> have opened
their play-houses, and announced the <i>Road to Ruin</i> until
further notice. The <i>Gamesters</i> was publicly rehearsed in St
James Square on Monday night.”</p>

<p>“<i>Feb. 10, 1793.</i> The profits of <span class="smcap">Faro</span> are become so
considerably reduced that most of the Banks now lose
almost every evening, after defraying the expenses of the
house, which are very considerable. Those <i>public spirited</i>
Ladies who give such frequent routs, do so at a certain gain:
for the sum of <span class="smcap">Twenty-five</span> guineas is regularly advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
by the bank holders towards the night’s expenses. The
<i>punters</i> at Mrs <span class="smcap">Hobart’s</span> and Mrs <span class="smcap">Sturt’s</span> Faro banks
have dropped off considerably; and those who continue are
got so <i>knowing</i> that heavy complaints are made that they
bring no grist to the mill. There have not been above
eight punters at Mrs <span class="smcap">Sturt’s</span> bank any night this season.
The <i>pigeons</i> are all flown, and the punters are nothing better
than hawks.”</p>

<p>“<i>14 Mar. 1793.</i> The <span class="smcap">Banking</span> <i>Ladies</i> in St James
Square do not see themselves much obliged to the <i>Abbé de
St Farre</i>, and his brother, for introducing so many noble
Emigrants to their houses. These people come with their
crown pieces and half guineas, and absolutely form a circle
round the Faro tables, to the total exclusion of our English
Lords and Ladies, who can scarcely get one <i>punt</i> during the
whole evening.”</p>

<p>“<i>2 May 1793.</i> A <i>Banking</i> Lady, in St James Square,
is about to commence a prosecution, because it is said, that
there was much <i>filching</i> at her <span class="smcap">Faro</span> table. The house was
quite in an uproar, on Tuesday night, in consequence of a
paragraph that appeared in a Morning Paper of the preceding
day. The Lady <i>vows</i> she will call in the aid of an
<i>Attorney</i> to <i>support her reputation</i>: and observes, that the
<i>credit</i> of her house will suffer, if such reports are permitted
to go unpunished. The <i>Faro Ladies</i> are, in the sporting
phrase, almost <i>done up</i>. Jewels, trinkets, watches, laces, &amp;c.,
are often at the pawnbrokers, and scarcely anything is left
to raise money upon except their <i>pads</i>.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> If justice is to be
<i>hoodwinked</i>, and <i>gambling</i> and <i>sharking</i> permitted, why not
make it an article of revenue, as in foreign countries, and lay
a heavy tax on it.”</p>

<p>“<i>2 Apr. 1794.</i> Lord <span class="smcap">Hampden’s</span> <i>Faro Bank</i> is broken
up for the present season. Lady Buckinghamshire, Mrs
Sturt and Mrs Concannon alternately divide the <i>Beau monde</i>
at their respective houses. Instead of having two different
hot suppers at <i>one</i> and <i>three</i> in the morning, the <i>Faro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Banks</i> will now scarcely afford bread and cheese and
porter.</p>

<p>“One of the Faro Banks in St James Square lost £7000
last year by bad debts. A young son of Levi is a considerable
debtor to one of them; but not finding it convenient to
pay what is not recoverable by law, he no longer appears in
those fashionable circles.”</p>

<p>“<i>4 Ap. 1794.</i> It is impossible to conceive a more
complete system of fraud and dishonour than is practised
every night at the <i>Faro banks</i>. Though every table has
four croupiers, yet the Bank holders find that double that
number are necessary to watch all the little tricks and artifices
of some of the <i>fashionable punters</i>. But Mrs G&mdash;&mdash;
beats all her associates in the art of doubling, or cocking
a card.”</p>

<p>“<i>25 June 1794.</i> The Faro Banks being no longer a
profitable game, certain Ladies in St James Square have
substituted another instead of it, called <i>Roulet</i>: but it is, in
fact, only the old game of E.O. under a different title.”</p>

<p>“<i>30 Dec. 1795.</i> It is to the credit of the rising generation
of females, that they have unanimously quitted those
infamous meetings, called Private Pharoes, where some of
their shameless Mammas, and the faded reputations of the
present age, still expose their vices, and cheat the boys who
have not been long enough in the army to wear out their
first cockades.”</p>

<p>“<i>17 Dec. 1794.</i> It is said to be the intention of some
of the leading circles in the fashionable world, to abolish the
tax of <i>Card money</i>,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> as an imposition upon hospitality. This
would prove the return of good sense, inasmuch as it tends
to substantiate the truth&mdash;that when one person invites
another to partake of the conviviality of his house, he should
not lay an impost upon him, even more exorbitant than that
which he would pay, were he to attend a Tavern Club.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
When a friend is invited, it is an insult to friendship, to
make him pay for his entertainment.”</p>

<p>“<i>22 March 1796.</i> The <i>tabbies</i> at Bath are in a state
of insurrection, in consequence of an example set by Lady
Elcho, who neither visits, nor receives Company that <i>pay for</i>
Cards: the laudable reformation is adopted so generally,
that many of the <i>Dowagers</i>, who have so long fed upon
<i>Card money</i>, are turning their thoughts to some more
creditable means of earning their livelihood.”</p>

<p>“<i>24 March 1796.</i> We hope the Ladies in London,
who stand upon a nice point of honour, will follow the
example of the Bath Ladies, and exclude the odious, and
pitiful, custom of taking card money at their houses. It is
a meanness, which no persons who pretend to the honour of
keeping good company, ought to allow. We are afraid that
many a party is formed, rather to derive benefit from the
card tables, than for the sake of hospitality.”</p>

<p>This custom died hard, for I find in the <i>Morning Herald</i>,
15th Dec. 1802: “In a pleasant village near the Metropolis,
noted for its constant ‘tea and turn-out’ parties, the extortion
of <i>Card Money</i> had, lately, risen to such a pitch, that it
was no unusual thing for the <i>Lady</i> of the House, upon the
breaking up of a table, to immediately examine the sub.
cargo of the candlestick, and, previous to the departure of
her guests, proclaim aloud the lamentable defalcation of a
pitiful shilling, which they might, perchance, have forgot
to <i>contribute</i>. We are happy to find that some of the most
respectable people in the place have resolved to discountenance
and abolish this <i>shabby genteel</i> custom, which has
too long prevailed; a shameful degradation of everything
like English hospitality.”</p>

<p>“<i>Times</i>, <i>2 Nov. 1797</i>. At some of our first Boarding
Schools, the fair pupils are now taught to play whist and
casino. Amongst their <i>winning</i> ways, this may not be the
least agreeable to Papa and Mamma.</p>

<p>“It is calculated that a clever child, by its Cards, and its
novels, may pay for its own education.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>“At a boarding school in the neighbourhood of Moorfields,
the mistress complains that she is unable to teach her
scholars either Whist, or Pharo.”</p>

<p>“<i>22 Dec. 1797.</i> So completely has gambling got the
better of dancing, that at a private Ball, last week, a gentleman
asking a young lady, from Bath, to dance the next two
dances, she very ingenuously replied, ‘Yes, if you will play
two rubbers at Casino.’”</p>

<p>Enough has been written to give us a good insight into
female gambling. I will now continue with that of the
men, and first let us have a description of a gaming house
from the <i>Times</i> of 14th Feb. 1793.</p>

<p>“The number of new gaming houses, established at the
West-end of the town, is, indeed, a mattter of very serious
evil: but they are not likely to decrease while examples of
the same nature are held forth in the higher circles of life.
It is needless to point out any one of these houses in particular:
it is sufficient for us to expose the tricks that are
practised at many of them to swindle the unsuspecting
young men of fortune, who are entrapped into these whirlpools
of destruction. The first thing necessary is, to give
the guests a good dinner and plenty of wine, which most of
these houses do, gratis. When they are sufficiently intoxicated,
and having lost all the money about them, their
acceptance is obtained to Bills of Exchange to a considerable
amount, which are frequently paid, to avoid the disagreeable
circumstance of a public exposition in a Court of
Justice, which is always threatened, though the gamesters
well know that no such measure durst be adopted by them.</p>

<p>“Should any reluctance, or hesitation, be shewn by the
injured party, to accept these Bills, he is shewn into a long
room, with a target at the end of it, and several pistols lying
about, where he is given to understand that these sharpers
practice a considerable time of the day in shooting at a
mark, and have arrived at such perfection in this exercise,
that they can shoot a pistol ball, within an inch of the
mark, from the common distance taken by duellists. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
hint is then dropped, that further hesitation will render
the use of the pistols necessary, and will again be the
case, should he ever divulge what he has seen, and
heard.</p>

<p>“If further particulars, or proofs, are wanting, they may be
known, on application to certain <i>Military characters</i>, who
have already made some noise in the world.”</p>

<p>Nor was it only public play&mdash;gambling was universal.
Michael Kelly, the vocalist, does not seem to think it anything
very extraordinary, when he tells the following story:&mdash;</p>

<p>“While at Margate, Mr and Mrs Crouch, and myself, were
staying at the Hotel, kept by a man whose manners were as
free and easy as any I have ever met with. He was proverbial
for his <i>nonchalance</i>, and a perfect master of the art
of making out a bill. One day, Johnstone dined with us,
and we drank our usual quantum of wine. In the course of
the evening, our bashful host, who, amongst other good
qualities, was a notorious gambler, forced upon us some
Pink Champagne, which he wished us to give our opinions
of. My friend Jack Johnstone, who never was an enemy to
the juice of the grape, took such copious draughts of the
sparkling beverage, that his eyes began to twinkle, and his
speech became somewhat of the thickest: my honest host,
on perceiving this, thinking, I suppose, to amuse him, entered
our room with a backgammon table and dice, and asked
Johnstone if he would like to play a game. Johnstone, at
that time, was considered fond of play, of which circumstance
mine host was perfectly aware. Mrs Crouch and I earnestly
entreated Jack to go to bed, but we could not prevail upon
him to do so; he whispered me, saying, ‘You shall see how
I will serve the fellow for his impudence’ and to it they
went. The end of the business was, that before they parted,
Johnstone won nearly two hundred pounds, and I retired to
bed, delighted to see the biter bit.”</p>

<p>Of another Kelly, or rather O’Kelly (the Colonel who was
owner of the famous race horse, Eclipse), Harcourt<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> tells some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
stories, and, indeed the book is a mine of anecdotes, some of
which I reproduce:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Dennis O’Kelly was much attached to Ascot, where
his horses occupied him by day, and the hazard table by
night.</p>

<p>“Here it was, that repeatedly turning over a <span class="smcap">Quire of
Bank Notes</span>, a gentleman asked him ‘what he was in want
of?’ when he replied, ‘he was looking for <i>a little one</i>.’ The
enquirer said ‘he could accommodate him, and desired to
know for what sum?’ When he answered ‘<span class="smcap">A Fifty</span>, or
something of <i>that sort</i>, just to set the <i>Caster</i>.’ At this time
it was supposed he had seven or eight thousand pounds in
notes in his hand, but no one for less than a <i>hundred</i>. He
always threw with great success; and, when he held the
box, was seldom known to refuse throwing for <i>any sum</i>
that the company chose to set him; and, when ‘out,’ was
always as liberal in <i>setting the Caster</i>, and preventing stagnation
of <i>trade at the table</i>, which, from the great property
always about him, it was his good fortune very often to
deprive of the last <i>floating guinea</i>, when the <i>box</i>, of course,
became <i>dormant</i> for want of a single adventurer.</p>

<p>“It was his usual custom to carry a great number of <i>bank
notes</i> in his waistcoat pocket, twisted up together with the
greatest indifference. When, in his attendance upon a
hazard table at Windsor, during the races, being a <i>standing
better</i>, and every chair full, a person’s hand was observed, by
those on the opposite side of the table, just in the act of
drawing two notes out of his pocket. The alarm was given,
and the hand, from the person behind, was <i>instantaneously</i>
withdrawn, and the notes left more than half out of the
pocket. The company became clamorous for the offender
being taken before a magistrate, and many attempted to
secure him for the purpose; the Captain very <i>philosophically</i>
seizing him by the collar, kicked him down stairs, and
exultingly exclaimed, ‘’twas a <i>sufficient punishment</i> to be
deprived of the pleasure of keeping company with <i>jontlemon</i>.’</p>

<p>“A bet for a large sum was once proposed to Col. O’Kelly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
at a race, and accepted. The proposer asked the Colonel
where lay his estates to answer for the amount if he lost?
‘My estates! by <i>Jasus</i>.’ cried O’Kelly. ‘Oh, if that’s what
you <i>mane</i>, I’ve a map of them here.’ Then, opening his
pocket book, he exhibited bank notes to ten times the sum
in question, and, ultimately, added the enquirer’s contribution
to them.”</p>

<p>“<i>An advertisement copied from the Courier, 5 Mar. 1794.</i>
As Faro is the most fashionable circular game in the <i>haut
ton</i>, in exclusion of melancholy Whist, and to prevent a
company being cantoned into separate parties, a gentleman,
of unexceptionable character, will, on invitation, do himself
the honour to attend the rout of any lady, nobleman, or
gentleman, with a Faro Bank and Fund, adequate to the
style of play, from 500 to 2000 guineas. Address G. A.
by letter, to be left at Mr Harding’s, Piccadilly, nearly
opposite Bond Street.&mdash;<i>N.B.</i> This advertisement will not
appear again.”</p>

<p>“On <i>Sunday</i> night, towards the end of December 1795.
Gen. Tarleton lost £800 at Mrs Concannon’s; Mr Hankey,
£300. The Prince was to have been there, but sent a late
excuse. Mr Boone of the Guards; Mr Derby, son of the
late Admiral, and Mr Dashwood, frequently rise winners or
losers of £5000 nightly. Lord Cholmondeley, Thompson
&amp; Co. were Faro Bankers at Brookes’s, till which there was
no Faro Bank of <i>male</i> celebrity, except at the Cocoa Tree.”</p>

<p>“Henry Weston, who was hanged for forgery, was nephew
to the late Admiral Sir Hugh Palliser.</p>

<p>“Having an unlimited control of the whole large property
of his employer, Mr Cowan, during his absence from town
he was tempted, first to gamble in the funds, where, being
unfortunate, he went next to a Gaming House in Pall Mall,
and lost a very large sum, and, at length, gamed away
nearly all his master’s property. This, he hoped to patch
up by forgery of Gen. Tonyn’s name, by which he obtained
from the Bank of England above £10,000. Even this only
lasted two nights; and, procuring a woman to personate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
General’s sister, he obtained another large supply, and went
off. He was soon taken, and cut his throat on his return;
but not effectually. He was convicted at the Old Bailey on
the 18th March 1796, and suffered on the 6th July, aged
only twenty-three years.</p>

<p>“He sent Lord Kenyon a list of a number of professional
gamblers, and, among them, was a person of very high rank.
Weston, at different times, lost above £46,000 at play;
and, at a house in Pall Mall, where he lost a considerable
part of it, three young officers also lost no less than
£35,000.</p>

<p>“It was stated, some time since, in the Court of King’s
Bench, that the dinners given by gambling houses in and
about Oxendon Street, amounted to £15,000 per annum!”</p>

<p>“The following facts were disclosed on a motion in the
Court of King’s Bench, 24 Nov. 1797. Joseph Atkinson
and Mary, his wife, had, for many years, kept a Gaming
House, No. 15, under the Piazza, Covent Garden. They,
daily, gave magnificent play dinners; cards of invitation
for which were sent to the clerks of merchants, bankers and
brokers in the city. Atkinson used to say he liked citizens,
whom he called <i>flats</i>, better than any one else, for, when
they had dined, they played freely; and, after they had lost
all their money, they had credit to borrow more. When he
had <i>cleaned them out</i>, when <i>the Pigeons were completely
plucked</i>, they were sent to some of their solvent friends.
After dinner, play was introduced, and, till dinner time the
next day, the different games at cards, dice and E.O. were
continually going on.</p>

<p>“Theophilus Bellasis had long been an infamous character,
well known at Bow Street, where he had been charged with
breaking into the counting-house of Sir James Sanderson,
Bart. Bellasis was sometimes clerk, and sometimes client,
to John Shepherd, an attorney of that Court; and at other
times, Shepherd was the prosecutor of those who kept
Gaming Houses, and Bellasis attorney. Sir William Addington
was so well aware that these two men commenced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
prosecutions solely for the purpose of <i>hush money</i> that he
refused to act. Atkinson at one time gave them £100, at
another £80; and, in this way, they had amassed an immense
sum, and undertook, for a specific amount, to defend keepers
of Gaming Houses against all prosecutions!</p>

<p>“Mr Garrow, on a former occasion, charged Atkinson with
using <i>dispatches</i>, that is, <i>loaded dice</i>, which in, five minutes,
would dispatch £500 out of the pocket of any young man
when intoxicated with champagne.”</p>

<p>“<i>Jan. 26, 1798.</i> A notice came on in the King’s Bench,
Cornet William Moore, 3rd Dragoon Guards, <i>v.</i> Captain
Hankey. The former had won off the latter, at play,
£14,000, for which Hankey had given his bond; but a
Court of Inquiry having declared that Moore had cheated
him out of it, he made his application to set aside the
bond.”</p>

<p>It will be remembered that in that famous prosecution,
in 1797, of Lady Buckinghamshire and her friends, their
manager, Henry Martindale, was fined £200. Next year
he was bankrupt, and we read that “The debts proved
under Mr Martindale’s commission amounted to £328,000,
besides Debts of Honour, which were struck off to the
amount of £150,000.”</p>

<p>“His failure is said to be owing to misplaced confidence
in a subordinate, who robbed him of thousands. The first
suspicion was occasioned by his purchasing an estate of
£500 a year, but other purchases followed to a considerable
extent, and it was soon discovered that the Faro Bank had
been robbed, sometimes of two thousand guineas a week!</p>

<p>“On the 14th of April 1798, other arrears to a large
amount were submitted to and rejected by the Commissioners,
who declared a first dividend of one shilling and fivepence
in the pound.”</p>

<p>“The Right Honourable Charles James Fox had an old
gambling debt to pay to Sir John Lade. Finding himself
in cash after a lucky run at Faro, he sent a complimentary
card to the knight, desiring to discharge the claim. Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
John no sooner saw the money than he called for pen and
ink, and began to figure. ‘What now,’ cried Fox. ‘Only
calculating the interest,’ replied the other. ‘Are you so,’
coolly rejoined Charles, and pocketed the cash.’ I thought
it was a debt of honour. As you seem to consider it a
trading debt, and as I make it an invariable rule to pay my Jew
creditors last, you must wait a little longer for your money.’”</p>

<p>Before leaving the eighteenth century, let us hear what
Col. Hanger<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> (4th Lord Coleraine) says of private gambling
in his time, and undoubtedly he mixed in the very highest
society. “If a gentleman in these days has but a few
guineas in his purse, and will walk directly up to the Faro
table, he will be the most welcome guest in the house; it is
not necessary for him to speak, or even bow, to a single lady
in the room, unless some unfortunate woman at the gaming-table
ask him politely for the loan of a few guineas; then
his answer need be but short&mdash;‘No, Dolly, no; can’t’; for
this ever will be received as wit, though the unfortunate
lady’s bosom may be heaving, not from the tenderer passions,
but with grief and despair at having lost the last farthing.</p>

<p>“When I first came into the world (1751?) there was no
such thing as a Faro table admitted into the house of a
woman of fashion; in those days they had too much pride
to receive tribute<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> from the proprietor of such a machine.
In former times there was no such thing as gaming at a
private house, although there was more deep play at the
clubs at that time than ever was before, or has been since.
It is lamentable to see lovely woman destroying her health
and beauty at six o’clock in the morning at a gaming-table.
Can any woman expect to give to her husband a vigorous
and healthy offspring, whose mind, night after night, is thus
distracted, and whose body is relaxed by anxiety and the
fatigue of late hours? It is impossible.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="pch">The Gambling Clubs&mdash;White’s, Cocoa Tree, Almack’s&mdash;A few gamblers
described&mdash;Stories of high play&mdash;White’s and its frequenters&mdash;Brookes’
and its players&mdash;Captain Gronow and his reminiscences of gambling&mdash;Gambling
by the English at Paris&mdash;The Duke of Wellington&mdash;Ball
Hughes&mdash;Scrope Davies&mdash;Raggett of White’s.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="beg">Hanger</span> speaks of gambling at the clubs, but in his time
there were very few of them, and the oldest of all was
“White’s” in St James Street. Originally a Chocolate
House, established in 1698, it was the rendezvous for the
Tories in London. It was destroyed by fire on 28th April,
1733, a fact which is immortalised by Hogarth in his sixth
picture of the <i>Rake’s Progress</i>. The earliest record of it, as
a Club, that remains, is a book of rules and list of members
of the old Club at White’s, dated 30th October 1736. In
1755 it removed to the east side of St James Street to No.
38, and there it still remains. In 1797, according to the
rules of the Club, “Every Member who plays at Chess,
Draughts, or Backgammon, do pay One Shilling each time of
playing by daylight, and half-a-crown each by candlelight.”
We have had many references to the gambling that took
place at White’s, and when betting is discussed, the Club’s
famous betting-book will be duly noticed. It is now one of
the most aristocratic clubs in London.</p>

<p>The Cocoa Tree Club, which was, probably, made into a
Club before 1746, and was somewhat lower down St James
Street than White’s, was the Whig Club, but it does not
seem to have been so much used for gambling as its elder
<i>confrère</i>.</p>

<p>Almack’s Club was essentially for gambling, and was
founded in 1764 by twenty-seven noblemen and gentlemen.
Among its original rules are the following:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>“21. No gaming in the eating room, except tossing up
for reckonings, on penalty of paying the whole bill of the
members present.</p>

<p>“40. That every person playing at the new guinea table
do keep fifty guineas before him.</p>

<p>“41. That every person playing at the twenty guinea table
do not keep less than twenty guineas before him.”</p>

<p>Here is an extract from the Club books which shows
the style of play. “Mr Thynne having won only 12,000
guineas during the last two months, retired in disgust. March
21, 1772.”</p>

<p>The Club subsequently became Goosetree’s, and after him
was taken by a wine merchant and money lender named
Brookes, and Brookes’s it is to this day, at 60 St James
Street, to which locality it moved from Pall Mall in October
1778.</p>

<p>These, with Arthur’s, were all the clubs for the nobility
and gentry, until the Regency, when clubs multiplied.
There were any amount of gambling houses, but they
were public&mdash;but, of course, a club was strictly confined to
its members.</p>

<p>So gambling went on merrily among all classes, as we may
see by the following notices from the <i>Morning Post</i>:</p>

<p>“<i>5 July 1797.</i> Is Mr Ogden (now called the Newmarket
Oracle), the same person who, five-and-twenty years
since, was an annual pedestrian to Ascot, covered with dust,
amusing himself with <i>pricking in the belt</i>, <i>hustling in the hat</i>,
&amp;c., amongst the lowest class of rustics, at the inferior
booths of the fair?</p>

<p>“Is D&mdash;k&mdash;y B&mdash;&mdash; w, who has now his snug farm, the
same person who, some years since, <i>drove post chaise</i> for
T&mdash;&mdash; y of Bagshot, could neither read nor write, and was introduced
to <i>the family</i> only by his pre-eminence at cribbage?</p>

<p>“Is Mr Twycross (with his phaeton), the same person who,
some years since, became a bankrupt in Tavistock Street,
immediately commenced the Man of Fashion at Bath, kept
running horses, &amp;c., <i>secundum artem</i>?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is Mr Phillips (who has now his town and country house,
in the most fashionable style,) the same who was, originally,
a linen draper and bankrupt at Salisbury, and who made his
first <i>family entré</i> in the metropolis, by his superiority at
<i>Billiards</i> (with Capt. Wallace, Orrell, &amp;c.) at Cropley’s in
Bow Street?</p>

<p>“Was poor carbuncled P&mdash;&mdash; e (so many years the favourite
decoy duck of <i>the family</i>) the very barber of Oxford who, in
the midst of the operation upon a gentleman’s face, laid down
his razor, swearing that he would never shave another man
so long as he lived, and immediately became the hero of the
Card Table, <i>the bones</i>, <i>the box</i>, and the <i>cock-pit</i>?”</p>

<p>“<i>5 April 1805.</i> The sum lately lost at play by a lady
of high rank is variously stated. Some say it does not
amount to more than £200,000, while others assert that it
is little short of £700,000. Her Lord is very unhappy on
the occasion, and is still undecided with respect to the best
mode to be adopted in the unfortunate predicament.”</p>

<p>“<i>30 June 1806.</i> The Marquis of H&mdash;&mdash; d is said to
have been so successful at play, this season, as to have
cleared £60,000. The Earl of B&mdash;&mdash; e has won upwards
of £50,000, clear of all deductions. A Right Reverend is
stated to be amongst those who are <i>minus</i> on this occasion.”</p>

<p>“<i>8 July 1806.</i> A certain Noble Marquis, who has been
very fortunate, this season, in his gaming speculations, had
a run of ill-luck last week. At one sitting his Lordship was
<i>minus</i> no less a sum than <i>thirteen thousand pounds</i>!”</p>

<p>“<i>15 July 1806.</i> The noble Marquis, who has been so
great a gainer this season, at <i>hazard</i>, never plays with anyone,
from a <span class="smcap">Prince</span>, to a <i>Commoner</i>, without having the
stakes <i>first</i> laid on the table. His lordship was always
considered as a <i>sure card</i>, but, now, his fame is established,
from the circumstance of his having cleared £35,000, after
deducting all his losses for the last six months.”</p>

<p>“<i>Morning Herald, 16 June 1804.</i> A noble Lord, lately
high in office, and who manifests a strong inclination to
be re-instated in his political power, lost, at the <span class="smcap">Union</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
a night or two back, 4000 guineas before twelve o’clock;
but, continuing to play, his luck took a turn, and he rose a
winner of a 1000 before five the next morning.”</p>

<p>I have, also, two newspaper cuttings, but know not
whence they came. “<i>Mar. 28, 1811.</i> The brother of a
Noble Marquis is said to have lately won, at <i>hazard</i>, upwards
of £30,000, all in one night!” “<i>April 3, 1811.</i>
A young gentleman of family and fortune lost £7000, on
Sunday Morning, at a gaming house in the neighbourhood
of Pall Mall.”</p>

<p>This brings us to the time when, owing to the mental
affliction of George III., the Prince of Wales became
Regent, and during his reign, both as Regent and King,
gambling throve; and I propose to quote somewhat from
Captain Gronow, whose chatty Reminiscences are about the
best of those times. But before doing so I must tell the
following anecdote which relates to that General Scott whom
Gronow mentions.</p>

<p>Lord C&mdash;&mdash; had a most unfortunate propensity to
gamble; and, in one night, he lost £33,000 to General
Scott. Mortified at his ill-fortune he paid the money and
wished to keep the circumstance secret; it was, however,
whispered about. His lordship, to divert his chagrin, went,
a few nights afterwards, to a Masquerade at Carlisle House,
Soho, and he found all the company running after three
Irish young ladies of the name of G&mdash;&mdash; e, in the character
of the three witches in <i>Macbeth</i>. These ladies were so well
acquainted with everything that was going on in the great
world that they kept the room in a continual roar of laughter
by the brilliancy of their wit, and the happiness of its
application to some people of rank who were present.
They knew Lord C&mdash;&mdash; and they knew of his loss, though
he did not know them. He walked up to them, and, in a
solemn tone of voice, thus addressed them:&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppi6 p1">“Ye black and midnight hags,&mdash;what do ye do?<br />
Live ye? or are ye aught that man may question?<br />
Quickly unclasp to me the book of fate,<br />
And tell if good, or ill, my steps await.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p class="ppi6"><i>First Witch.</i> “All hail, C&mdash;&mdash;e! all hail to thee!<br />
Once annual lord of thousands thirty-three!”</p>
<p class="ppi6"><i>Second Witch.</i> “All hail, C&mdash;&mdash;e! all hail to thee!<br />
All hail! though poor thou soon shalt be!”</p>
<p class="ppi6"><i>Hecate.</i> “C&mdash;&mdash;e, all hail! thy evil star<br />
Sheds baleful influence&mdash;Oh, beware!<br />
Beware that Thane! Beware that Scott!<br />
Or, poverty shall be thy lot!<br />
He’ll drain thy youth as dry as hay&mdash;<br />
Hither, Sisters, haste away!”</p>

<p class="p1">At the concluding words, whirling a watchman’s rattle,
which she held in her hand, the dome echoed with the
sound; the astonished peer shrunk into himself with terror&mdash;retired&mdash;vowed
never to lose more than a hundred pounds
at a sitting; abided by the determination, and retrieved his
fortune.
<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
“The politics of White’s Club were, then, decidedly
Tory. It was here that play was carried on to an extent
which made many ravages in large fortunes, the traces of
which have not disappeared at the present day. General
Scott, the father-in-law of George Canning and the Duke of
Portland, was known to have won, at White’s, £200,000;
thanks to his notorious sobriety and knowledge of the game
of whist. The General possessed a great advantage over his
companions by avoiding those indulgences at the table,
which used to muddle other men’s brains. He confined
himself to dining off something like a boiled chicken, with
toast and water; by such a regimen he came to the whist
table with a clear head, and possessing, as he did, a remarkable
memory, with great coolness and judgment, he was
able, honestly, to win the enormous sum of £200,000.</p>

<p>“At Brooke’s, for nearly half a century, the play was of a
more gambling character than at White’s. Faro and Macao
were indulged in to an extent which enabled a man to win,
or to lose, a considerable fortune in one night. It was here
that Charles James Fox, Selwyn, Lord Carlisle, Lord Robert
Spencer, General Fitzpatrick, and other great Whigs, won,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and lost, hundreds of thousands; frequently remaining at
the table for many hours without rising.</p>

<p>“On one occasion, Lord Robert Spencer contrived to lose
the last shilling of his considerable fortune, given to him by
his brother, the Duke of Marlborough: General Fitzpatrick,
being much in the same condition, they agreed to raise a
sum of money, in order that they might keep a Faro bank.
The members of the club made no objection, and, ere long,
they carried out their design. As is generally the case, the
bank was a winner, and Lord Robert bagged, as his share of
the profits, £100,000. He retired, strange to say, from the
fœtid atmosphere of play, with the money in his pocket, and
never again gambled. George Harley Drummond, of the
famous banking house, Charing Cross, only played once, in
his whole life, at White’s Club, at whist, on which occasion
he lost £20,000 to Brummell. This event caused him to
retire from the banking house, of which he was a partner.</p>

<p>“Lord Carlisle was one of the most remarkable victims
amongst the players at Brooke’s, and Charles Fox, his
friend, was not more fortunate, being, subsequently, always
in pecuniary difficulties. Many a time, after a long night of
hard play, the loser found himself at the Israelitish establishment
of Howard and Gibbs, then the fashionable and patronized
money-lenders. These gentlemen never failed to make
hard terms with the borrower, although ample security was,
invariably, demanded.</p>

<p>“The Guard’s Club was established for the three regiments
of Foot Guards, and was conducted upon a military
system. Billiards and low whist were the only games indulged
in. The dinner was, perhaps, better than at most
clubs, and considerably cheaper. Arthur’s and Graham’s
were less aristocratic than those I have mentioned; it
was, at the latter, that a most painful circumstance took
place. A nobleman, of the highest position and influence
in society, was detected in cheating at cards, and, after a
trial, which did not terminate in his favour, he died of a
broken heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“Upon one occasion, some gentlemen, of both White’s
and Brooke’s, had the honour to dine with the Prince
Regent, and, during the conversation, the Prince inquired
what sort of dinners they got at their clubs; upon which,
Sir Thomas Stepney, one of the guests, observed that their
dinners were always the same, ‘the eternal joints, or beefsteaks,
the boiled fowl with oyster sauce, and an apple tart&mdash;this
is what we have, sir, and very monotonous fare it is.’
The Prince, without further remark, rang the bell for his
cook, Wattier, and, in the presence of those who dined at
the Royal table, asked him whether he would take a house
and organize a dinner club. Wattier assented, and named
Madison, the Prince’s page, manager, and Labourie, from
the Royal kitchen, as the cook. The club flourished only a
few years, owing to the high play that was carried on there.
The Duke of York patronized it, and was a member. The
dinners were exquisite; the best Parisian cooks could not
beat Labourie. The favourite game played there was
Macao. Upon one occasion Jack Bouverie, brother of Lady
Heytesbury, was losing large sums, and became very irritable;
Raikes, with bad taste, laughed at Bouverie, and
attempted to amuse us with some of his stale jokes; upon
which Bouverie threw his play bowl, with the few counters
it contained, at Raikes’ head: unfortunately, it struck him,
and made the City dandy angry, but no serious results
followed this open insult.”</p>

<p>Captain Gronow gives a personal story of his own gambling.
After Napoleon’s escape from Elba, he had the offer
of an appointment on the staff of General Picton, but his
funds were somewhat low. “So I set about thinking how
I should manage to get my outfit, in order to appear at
Brussels in a manner worthy of the <i>aide-de-camp</i> of the
great general. As my funds were at a low ebb, I went
to Cox and Greenwood’s, those staunch friends of the hard
up soldier. Sailors may talk of the ‘little cherub that sits
up aloft,’ but commend me for liberality, kindness, and
generosity to my old friends in Craig’s Court. I there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
obtained £200, which I took with me to a gambling house
in St James’ Square, where I managed, by some wonderful
accident, to win £600; and, having thus obtained the sinews
of war, I made numerous purchases, amongst others, two
first-rate horses at Tattersall’s for a high figure.”</p>

<p>He gives several instances of the English love for gambling,
as exemplified at Paris, after its occupation by the
Allies.</p>

<p>“Fox, the secretary of the embassy, was an excellent
man, but odd, indolent, and careless in the extreme; he
was seldom seen in the daytime, unless it was either at the
embassy, in a state of <i>negligée</i>, or in bed. At night, he used
to go to the Salon des Etrangers; and, if he possessed a
Napoleon, it was sure to be thrown away at hazard, or <i>rouge
et noir</i>. On one occasion, however, fortune favoured him in
a most extraordinary manner. The late Henry Baring having
recommended him to take the dice box, Fox replied,
‘I will do so for the last time, for all my money is thrown
away upon this infernal table.’ Fox staked all he had in his
pockets; he threw in <i>eleven</i> times, breaking the bank, and
taking home for his share 60,000 francs. After this, several
days passed without any tidings being heard of him; but,
upon calling at the embassy to get my passport <i>viséd</i>, I
went into his room, and saw it filled with Cashmere shawls,
silk, Chantilly veils, bonnets, gloves, shoes, and other articles
of ladies’ dress. On my asking the purpose of all this
millinery, Fox replied, ‘Why, my dear Gronow, it was the
only means to prevent those rascals at the Salon winning
back my money.’</p>

<p>“The play which took place in these saloons was,
frequently, of the most reckless character; large fortunes
were often lost, the losers disappearing, never more to be
heard of. Amongst the English <i>habitués</i> were the Hon.
George T&mdash;&mdash;, the late Henry Baring, Lord Thanet, Tom
Sowerby, Cuthbert, Mr Steer, Henry Broadwood, and Bob
Arnold.</p>

<p>“The late Henry Baring was more fortunate at hazard than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
his countrymen, but his love of gambling was the cause of
his being excluded from the banking establishment. Col.
Sowerby, of the Guards, was one of the most inveterate
players in Paris: and, as is frequently the case with a fair
player, a considerable loser. But, perhaps, the most incurable
gamester amongst the English, was Lord Thanet, whose
income was not less than £50,000 a year, every farthing of
which he lost at play. Cuthbert dissipated the whole of his
fortune in the like manner. In fact, I do not remember any
instance where those who spent their time in this den did
not lose all they possessed....</p>

<p>“Amongst others who visited the Salon des Etrangers were
Sir Francis Vincent, Gooch, Green, Ball Hughes, and many
others whose names I no longer remember. As at Crockford’s,
a magnificent supper was provided every night, for all
who thought proper to avail themselves of it. The games
principally played were <i>rouge et noir</i> and hazard; the former
producing an immense profit; for, not only were the whole
of the expenses of this costly establishment defrayed by the
winnings of the bank, but a very large sum was paid annually
to the municipality of Paris. I recollect a young Irishman,
Mr Gough, losing a large fortune at this <i>tapis vert</i>. After
returning home about two <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> he sat down and wrote a
letter, giving reasons why he was about to commit suicide:
these, it is needless to say, were simply his gambling reverses.
A pistol shot through the brain terminated his existence.
Sir Francis Vincent&mdash;a man of old family and considerable
fortune&mdash;was another victim of this French hell, who
contrived to get rid of his magnificent property, and then
disappeared from society.”</p>

<p>“Soon after Lord Granville’s appointment [as British
Ambassador] a strange occurrence took place at one of the
public gambling houses. A colonel, on half-pay, in the
British service, having lost every farthing he possessed,
determined to destroy himself, together with all who were
instrumental to his ruin. Accordingly, he placed a canister
full of fulminating powder under the table, and set it on fire:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
it blew up, but, fortunately, no one was hurt. The police
arrested the colonel, and placed him in prison; he was,
however, through the humane interposition of our ambassador,
sent out of France as a madman.”</p>

<p>The Duke of Wellington<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> had, in his early career, lost a
considerable sum of money at play, and had been on the
point of selling his commission in Dublin, with the view of
relieving himself from some debts of honour which he had
incurred.</p>

<p>“At a dinner party at Mr Greenwood’s, of that excellent
firm, Cox &amp; Greenwood, I met Sir Harry Calvert, then
Adjutant-General, who accompanied the Duke of York, as
one of his staff, in his disastrous campaign in Holland; and
he told us the following anecdote:&mdash;Lord Camden, the
Viceroy, had been applied to by Lord Mornington, the
brother of Captain Wesley (so the name was then spelt),
for a Commissionership of Customs, or anything else in the
gift of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, as it was the intention
of the Captain to sell his commission to pay his debts.
Lord Camden, in an interview with Captain Wesley, inquired
whether he left the army in disgust, or what motive
induced him to relinquish a service in which he was well
qualified to distinguish himself. Captain Wesley explained
everything that had occurred, upon which the Lord Lieutenant
expressed a wish to be of service to him. ‘What
can I do for you? Point out any plan by which you can
be extricated from your present difficulties.’ The answer
was, ‘I have no alternative but to sell my commission; for I
am poor, and unable to pay off my debts of honour.’
‘Remain in the army,’ said Lord Camden, ‘and I will
assist you in paying off your liabilities.’ ‘I should like to
study my profession at Angers,’ replied the young soldier,
‘for the French are the great masters of the art of war.’
Lord Camden assented to the proposition, supplied him
with the means of living in France, and paid his debts....</p>

<p>“The lesson the Duke of Wellington had learnt at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
gambling table, as a young man, was deeply impressed
upon him; he, afterwards, never touched a card; and so
firmly did he set his face against gambling, that, in Paris,
none of his staff, from Lord Fitzroy Somerset down to
Freemantle, was ever to be seen either at Frascati’s, or the
Salon des Etrangers.”</p>

<p>Ball Hughes was a dandy of the Regency, and from his
fortune he was nick-named “the golden Ball”; of him
Gronow says: “His fortune had dwindled down to a fourth
of its original amount, for he was, perhaps, the greatest
gambler of his day. His love of play was such, that, at
one period of his life, he would rather play at pitch and
toss than be without his favourite excitement. He told
me that, at one time, he had lost considerable sums at
battledore and shuttlecock. On one occasion, immediately
after dinner, he and the eccentric Lord Petersham commenced
playing with these toys, and continued hard at
work during the whole of the night; next morning, he was
found by his valet lying on the ground fast asleep, but
ready for any other species of speculation.”</p>

<p>Of another dandy, Scrope Davies, he says: “As was the
case with many of the foremost men of that day, the
greater number of his hours were passed at the gambling
table, where, for a length of time, he was eminently successful;
for he was a first-rate calculator. He seldom played
against individuals; he preferred going to the regular establishments.
But, on one occasion, he had, by a remarkable
run of good luck, completely ruined a young man, who had
just reached his majority, and come into the possession of a
considerable fortune. The poor youth sank down upon a
sofa, in abject misery, when he reflected that he was a
beggar; for he was on the point of marriage. Scrope
Davies, touched by his despair, entered into conversation
with him, and ended by giving him back the whole of his
losses, upon a solemn promise that he would never play
again. The only thing that Scrope retained of his winnings
was one of the little carriages of that day, called a <i>dormeuse</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
from its being fitted up with a bed, for he said, ‘When I
travel in it, I shall sleep the better for having acted rightly.’
The youth kept his promise; but when his benefactor
wanted money, he forgot that he owed all he possessed to
Scrope’s generosity, and refused to assist him.</p>

<p>“For a long time Scrope Davies was a lucky player; but
the time arrived when Fortune deserted her old favourite;
and, shortly after the Dandy dynasty was overthrown, he
found himself unable to mingle with the rich, the giddy, and
the gay. With the wreck of his fortune, and, indeed, with
little to live upon beyond the amount of his own Cambridge
fellowship, he sought repose in Paris, and there, indulging in
literary leisure, bade the world farewell.”</p>

<p>“Raggett,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> the well known club proprietor of White’s,
and the Roxburgh club in St James’s Square, was a notable
character in his way. He began life as a poor man, and
died extremely rich. It was his custom to wait upon the
members of these clubs whenever play was going on. Upon
one occasion, at the Roxburgh, the following gentlemen,
Hervey Combe, Tippoo Smith, Ward (the member for
London), and Sir John Malcolm, played for high stakes at
whist; they sat during that night, viz., Monday, the following
day and night, and only separated on Wednesday
morning at eleven o’clock; indeed, the party only broke up
then, owing to Hervey Combe being obliged to attend the
funeral of one of his partners who was buried on that day.
Hervey Combe, on looking over his card, found that he
was a winner of thirty thousand pounds from Sir John
Malcolm, and he jocularly said, ‘Well, Sir John, you shall
have your revenge whenever you like.’ Sir John replied,
‘Thank you; another sitting of the kind will oblige me to
return again to India.’ Hervey Combe, on settling with
Raggett, pulled out of his pocket, a handful of counters,
which amounted to several hundred pounds, over and above
the thirty thousand he had won of the baronet, and he gave
them to Raggett, saying, ‘I give them to you for sitting so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
long with us, and providing us with all required.’ Raggett
was overjoyed, and, in mentioning what had occurred to one
of his friends, a few days afterwards, he added, ‘I make it a
rule never to allow any of my servants to be present when
gentlemen play at my clubs, for it is my invariable custom
to sweep the carpet after the gambling is over, and I,
generally, find on the floor a few counters, which pays me
for the trouble of sitting up. By this means I have made a
decent fortune.’”</p>

<p class="pch">Hanging, the penalty for losing&mdash;Suicide&mdash;Officer cashiered&mdash;Reminiscences of an
exiled gambler&mdash;Description of the principal gaming-houses at the West
End in 1817.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="beg">The</span> <i>Annual Register</i> about this time supplies us with
several gambling anecdotes, the following being almost
incredible:&mdash;<i>15th April 1812.</i>&mdash;“On Wednesday evening
an extraordinary investigation took place at Bow Street.
Croker, the officer, was passing along the Hampstead road,
when he observed, at a short distance before him, two men
on a wall, and, directly after, saw the tallest of them, a stout
man, about six feet high, hanging by his neck, from a lamp
post attached to the wall, being that instant tied up and
turned off by the short man. This unexpected and extraordinary
sight astonished the officer; he made up to the
spot with all speed; and, just after he arrived there, the tall
man, who had been hanged, fell to the ground, the handkerchief,
with which he had been suspended, having given way.
Croker produced his staff, said he was an officer, and demanded
to know of the other man the cause of such conduct.
In the meantime, the man who had been hanged recovered,
got up, and, on Croker’s interfering, gave him a violent blow
on the nose, which nearly knocked him backwards. The
short man was endeavouring to make off; however, the
officer procured assistance, and both were brought to the
office, when the account they gave was that they worked on
canals. They had been together on Wednesday afternoon,
tossed up for money, and afterwards for their clothes; the
tall man, who was hanged, won the other’s jacket, trousers,
and shoes; they then tossed up which should hang the
other, and the short one won the toss. They got upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
wall, the one to submit, and the other to hang him on the
lamp iron. They both agreed in this statement. The tall
one, who had been hanged, said, if he had won the toss, he
would have hanged the other. He said he then felt the
effects of his hanging in his neck, and his eyes were so much
swelled that he saw double. The magistrates expressed
their horror and disgust, and ordered the man who had been
hanged to find bail for the violent and unjustifiable assault
on the officer, and the short one for hanging the other. Not
having bail, they were committed to Bridewell for trial.”</p>

<p><i>7th Feb. 1816.</i>&mdash;“Yesterday, a gentleman, the head in
a firm of a first-rate concern in the City, put a period to his
existence by blowing out his brains. He had gone to the
masquerade at the Argyll Rooms a few nights since, and
accompanied a female home in a coach with two men,
friends of the woman. When they got to her residence, the
two men proposed to the gentleman to play for a dozen of
champagne to treat the lady with, which the gentleman
declined. They, however, after a great deal of persuasion,
prevailed on him to play for small sums, and, according to
the usual tricks of gamblers, allowed him to win at first, till
they began to play for double, when, there is no doubt, the
fellows produced loaded dice, and the gentleman lost to the
amount of £1800, which brought him to his reflection and
senses. He then invented an excuse for not paying that
sum, by saying he was under an agreement with his partner
not to draw for a larger amount than £300 for his private
account, and gave them a draft for that amount, promising
the remainder at a future day. This promise, however, he
did not attend to, not feeling himself bound by such a
villainous transaction. But the robbers found out who he
was, and his residence, and had the audacity to go yesterday
morning, armed with bludgeons, and attack him publicly on
his own premises, in the presence of those employed there,
demanding payment of their nefarious debt of <i>honour</i>, and
threatening him, if he did not pay, that he should fight.
This exposure had such an effect upon his feelings, that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
made an excuse to retire, when he destroyed himself by
blowing out his brains with a pistol. This rash act is additionally
to be lamented, as it prevents the bringing to condign
punishment the plundering villains who were the cause
of it, there being no evidence to convict them.”</p>

<p>“<i>Horse Guards, 18th Nov. 1816.</i>&mdash;At a general Court-martial
held at Cambray, in France, on the 23rd September
1816, and continued by adjournments to the 26th of the
same month, Lieutenant the Honourable Augustus Stanhope,
of the 12th regiment of Light Dragoons, was arraigned
on the undermentioned charge, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>“For behaving in a scandalous, infamous manner, such as
is unbecoming the character of an officer and a gentleman,
in conspiring, with a certain other person, to draw in and
seduce Lord Beauchamp to game and play with them, for
the purposes of gain and advantage; and that, in pursuance
of such conspiracy, he, Lieutenant Stanhope (having engaged
Lord Beauchamp to come to his quarters in Paris, on Sunday,
the 17th day of March 1816, upon an invitation to
dine with him), did, in company and concert of such other
person, draw in, seduce, and prevail upon Lord Beauchamp
to play with them at a certain game of chance with cards,
for very high stakes, whereby, on an account kept by them,
Lieut. Stanhope, and the said other person, or one of them,
of the losses and gains in the course of the play, he, Lieut.
Stanhope, claimed to have won from Lord Beauchamp the
sum of £8000 and upwards, and the said other person
claimed to have won off Lord Beauchamp the further sum
of £7000 and upwards.</p>

<p>“That, in further pursuance of the said concert and conspiracy,
he, Lord Beauchamp, at the same time and place,
was required by Lieut. Stanhope to write and sign two promissory
notes, or engagements, to pay at the expiration of
three years the said several sums of money so claimed to
have been won off him, Lord Beauchamp, by Lieut. Stanhope
and the said other person respectively.</p>

<p>“That he, Lord Beauchamp, was, at that time, about sixteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
years of age, ignorant of, and unused to play, and affected
by the wine he had been prevailed upon to take by the
parties.”</p>

<p>Lieut. Stanhope was found guilty and dismissed from the
army.</p>

<p>The <i>Annual Register</i> also gives numerous cases of duels
arising from gambling, but they are, comparatively, uninteresting,
and are all of the same type, paltry quarrels over
the gaming-table.</p>

<p>We have a metrical description of gambling about this
time supposed to have been written by a gambler who had
to retire to France, and I here give a portion of it.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p class="p1">This pamphlet, which has a companion called “The
Pigeons,” gives a very curious list of the most fashionable
gaming houses in existence in 1817.</p>

<p>“Of <i>hells</i> in general, it may be said that they are <i>infernally</i>
productive, since Mr T&mdash;l&mdash;r finds that the banking
business is nothing compared to these money mills, and since
so many fortunes have been made from them. Who would
think that a man could <i>rise</i> from one of these <i>lower regions</i>
to a seat in Parliament? or that high military rank could be
purchased by ‘The Colour’s red’&mdash;‘Gentlemen, make your
game!’</p>

<p>Major-General R&mdash;&mdash; w, M.P., thus got his high promotion
and his seat in the British Senate; for his papa was
<i>n’importe</i>; but, progressively (and in a very odd way too),
he got a little money, which, placing in a hell of which he
was proprietor, he soon purchased an estate, and bought his
son on in the army. Many other instances, too tedious to
mention, have occurred of fortune thus made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>By a house of fashionable resort being called a club-house,
the proprietors are enabled to exclude <i>wolves in
sheep’s clothing</i>, <i>i.e.</i> spies and informers; for, by taking a
mere trifle for a subscription, you get a knowledge of the
subscriber, whether a <i>good man and true, or not</i>; and, being
entered in a book&mdash;before he can <i>turn over a new leaf</i>, he
may be <i>turned to</i> good account.</p>

<p>Where the houses are not really, or apparently, club-houses,
large sums are often paid to police officers, as well
as to more imposing informers, who contrive to introduce
themselves. Bob Holloway pretty well knew this, as he
was, literally, in the pay of all of them, of which more may
be said in time and place. Hush money varies according
to the magnitude of the concern, from £250 to £1000 per
annum.</p>

<p>The produce of this bank (which Paddy B&mdash;&mdash; calls the

<p class="pc1 mid"><span class="smcap">Corner house&mdash;Red Baize Door</span>&mdash;<i>called</i> <span class="smcap">a Club
House.</span></p>

<p class="pc1 lmid"><i>Firm: Messrs Fielder, Miller and Carlos. Formerly Fielder,
Roubel, Miller and Co.</i></p>

<p class="p1">This is what is called a topping house, where high rank
and title resort. We mentioned in the poem the luck of a
certain Duke’s son there; and, of late, there has been a
lucky run in favour of the frequenters of the bank&mdash;but
<i>lauda finem</i>. Its crisis has arrived.</p>

<p>The noble Marquess, on the night that he lost the money
at No. 40 which was closed against him, went full charged
with the Tuscan grape, and attacked poor Fielder, <i>vi et
pugnis</i>, and, at length, was necessitated to leave this house
also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Here, all things are in a very high style, served on plate,
et cetera. It is supposed that the <i>customer’s specie</i> is melted
down to furnish this luxury, which is reversing the ordinary
plan: it is, commonly, the family plate which is melted by
the gamester into specie; but here it is the current coin
which is molten and shaped into salvers, waiters, &amp;c. This
is, however, all in the way of business; for we have heard of
parson’s wives having silk gowns made out of burial scarves,
and we know a presbyterian minister who has converted
mourning rings into a splendid piece of plate. Therefore,
why should not these conveyancers of property, convey a
portion into their wives and mistress’s pockets, or <i>ridicules</i>,
and transform guineas into gold snuff boxes; or crowns, &amp;c.,
into a service of plate?</p>

<p>The receipts of these houses are immense: We know
the wife of a proprietor of a hell, not an hundred miles from
St James’s Palace, who was so majestic in her deportment,
and so magnificent in her attire, that she gained the name of
<i>Proserpine</i>.</p>

<p>The neighbourhood of Bennet Street is very convenient:
if a pigeon be refused admittance on the score of not being
known, and receive the <i>stale answer</i>&mdash;‘Sir, this house is only
open to the gentlemen of the Club,’ he has only to <i>go down</i>
St James’s Street into the Square or to Pall Mall, and he
will find accommodation all the way: the descent is <i>easy</i>
even to the most intoxicated dandy or guardsman, who will
experience the truth of the ‘<i>facilis descensus Averni</i>.’</p>

<p class="p1">This snug little <i>trap</i> is doing remarkably well. <i>Fama
volat</i>, that it has netted thirty thousand within twelve
months. Whether the exact sum, in so very small a time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
be true or not, we cannot pretend to say; but we know that
a great deal of work is done there, and it is said to have
divided twenty-seven thousand in the half-year ending
Midsummer 1817.</p>

<p>A certain little doctor is a great friend (we do not say a
decoy) to the house, and, of course, a great favourite. There
are many links to this chain; and a good bill would be done
there, or an I.O.U. taken from <i>gem’men</i> of respectability.</p>

<p>There is a <i>littleness</i> about the concern, both outside and
inside; and your topping Greeks prefer a larger scale of
establishment. The firm, notwithstanding, goes on slow and
sure; and there is no saying what they may realise with
time, brisk trade and good customers, although great complaints
are made of emigrations to France, the Insolvent Act,
the want of <i>honour</i> in the young men of the present day,
and, <i>especially, of our disclosures of their mysteries</i>. The north
country dialect is here spoken in perfection.</p>

<p>One of the firm is <i>Abbot</i>, of a religious establishment of a
somewhat different kind. It is a <i>nunnery</i>, to which confessors
are, of course, admitted at the usual hours, on the
terms, to use a sporting phrase, of play, or pay. This Abbot
is said to be worth nearly a hundred thousand pounds.
‘Two strings to my bow’ is his suitable motto, for he has
a wife and family also.</p>

<p>He is more <i>parsimonious</i> than abstemious, as befits the
order of which he is the worthy principal, and of which we
shall furnish a ludicrous instance. He once had particular
occasion for a sovereign. Now, how could he save his
money? He was extricated by a most delightful thought,
and he, accordingly, sat down to play against his own firm
for <i>one pound</i>. Oh! what a slippery jade is Fortune!
Luck was against him, and he rose <span class="smcap">IN DEBT</span> to the bank,
little short of £500. His junior partners, however, most
liberally (it is said) took the entire case into their serious
consideration, and <span class="smcap">FORGAVE HIM THE DEBT</span>! What other
house can produce an instance of such splendid munificence?&mdash;Lieut.
N&mdash;&mdash; g, R.N., has lately extracted from the house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
above £2000. They would almost as soon see the devil as
the lieutenant, for Fortune has never deserted him hitherto:&mdash;but,
even this, like a fire to insurance offices, or a large
prize in a lottery, is not without its good effects! It is,
after all, baiting with sprats to catch salmon. We are
happy to find that this officer has been so prudent as to
retire on his good luck!</p>

<p>To Mr Holdsworth, quitting a neighbouring hell under
more respectable circumstances, pocketing a trifle of what is
so easily gained, can, he thinks, be no very great harm.
However, it now became absolutely necessary that he should
do business on his own account, when circumstances utterly
prevented his doing it on the account of others. Papa Leach
advanced the needful, and he is, as we see, one of this firm.</p>

<p>Perhaps Mr Watson may have some recollection, however
imperfect, of Messrs Crook and Co., of York Street,
Covent Garden, his old masters. We may, probably, at a
future opportunity, assist the elucidation of some occurrences
in that quarter. We believe that Mr Crook never speaks of
him with any particular respect! It was here that Mr
L&mdash;&mdash; p D&mdash;&mdash; s lately won nearly £5000 of Crockford,
Kelly, Lavisne, &amp;c. It is a great chance if they have not
obtained their revenge ere this.</p>

<p>A singular escape was recently sustained here by Major
A&mdash;&mdash; y. He is not only a man of mettle, but of <i>metal</i>;
in plain English, he has money, and was allowed partial
success, <i>pour encourager les autres</i>. We only <i>suppose</i> that
arrangements were made for his next appearance. All were
silent and ready. The anxious moment arrived, St James’s
clock struck nine,&mdash;the customary signal to begin,&mdash;yet he
had not arrived: therefore, it was thought advisable to
commence operations. The company loudly expressed
impatience and offence at waiting for anyone. The house
conceded, and lo! the cards were dealt&mdash;when, to the
astonishment and dismay of the company, there were <i>fifteen
trente et un et après</i>, in one deal! wonderful! mysterious
chance! The Major entered at this critical moment, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
took out his well-stored pocket-book; but, when he learnt
what had happened, and saw his narrow escape, he coolly
returned it to his pocket, saying, as he retired, ‘I will never
enter a house where such a <i>chance</i> has happened!!’ We
need not be surprised at the sum which <span class="smcap">THIS</span> firm is said to
have cleared.</p>

hoax was practised on them the year before last, when
thieves, in the characters of police officers, led on by an
‘alien’ disguised in the habiliments of officers of the foot
guards, introduced themselves, and carried off all the cash,
to the great discomfiture of the party, and to the alarm of
the respectable visitors there assembled. Colonel N&mdash;&mdash; g
went off like a shot; many forgot to <i>take their change</i>; and
some young bloods were thought to have taken more than
their change: it was a most delicious scamper. The Argus-eyed
attendants have been more vigilant ever since; and a
dark-looking man in a greatcoat, or other suspicious habit,
is very much watched.</p>

<p>We felicitate the town on this establishment: it is the

the pigeon who wishes to be soon <i>done</i>; for what will not

<p class="pch">Crockford’s Club&mdash;His Life&mdash;His new Club-house&mdash;Epigrams thereon&mdash;Ude
and the Magistrate&mdash;Description of Club-house&mdash;Anecdotes of
Crockford’s.</p>

<p class="pn"><i>À propos</i> of Crockford, or Crockey, as he was familiarly called,
his was perhaps the most celebrated gambling house in London,
and deserves especial mention. It was on the site now
occupied by the Devonshire Club, No. 50 St James’s Street.</p>

<p>William Crockford was born in 1775, his father being a
fishmonger in a small way of business, having a shop adjoining
Temple Bar, which was pulled down in 1846. His
father dying when he was young, the business was carried
on, first by his mother, and afterwards by himself, but he
soon took to betting and gambling, became a proficient
at cards, and was more particularly skilled in the games
of whist, piquet and cribbage; he frequented the better
kind of sporting houses in the neighbourhood of St James’s
market, where the latter game, more especially, was much
played, and for large sums, by opulent tradesmen and others.
He made some money at gambling, became connected with
a gaming house in King Street, St James’s, and then he
turned his attention to horse racing; frequenting Tattersalls
as a bookmaker, and becoming the owner of race horses.
He had a splendid mansion and grounds at Newmarket,
where he trained his stud, and at one time owned the celebrated
horse Sultan, the sire of Bay Middleton, who won
the Derby in 1836. But the roguery at Newmarket was
too much even for him, and he sold his racing stud, and
confined himself to his London businesses. About this time
he is metrically described in a little pamphlet called “Leggiana,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
which described the <i>Legs</i> who used to frequent The
Sun tavern in Jermyn Street.</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“Seated within the box, to window nearest,<br />
See <i>Crocky</i>, richest, cunningest, and queerest<br />
Of all the motley group that here assemble<br />
To sport their blunt, chaff, blackguard and dissemble;<br />
Who live (as slang has termed it) on the mace,<br />

Bespeaks not inward store of mental grace;<br />
Besides, each night, he’s drunk as any lord,<br />
And clips his mother English every word.<br />

Is screw’d right well upon his brawny shoulders;<br />
He’s quick as thought, and ripe at calculation,<br />

His wits at work, as hard as he is able,<br />
His odds matur’d, at scarce a moment’s pains,<br />

In some enormous, captivating wager,<br />
‘Gainst one horse winning <i>Derby</i>, <i>Oaks</i> and <i>Leger</i>.<br />
The bait is tak’n by some astonished wight,<br />
Who chuckles, thinking it a glorious bite,<br />
Nor takes the pains the figures o’er to run,<br />
And see, by calculation, that <i>he’s done</i>;<br />
While <i>Crocky</i> books it, cash, <i>for certain, won</i>.<br />
And why, forsooth, is <i>Crocky</i> to be blamed<br />
More than those legs who’re <i>honourable</i> named,<br />
Whose inclination is plain sense to jockey,<br />
But who lack brains to <i>work the pull</i> like <i>Crocky</i>?<br />
Who, by the way, gives vast accommodation,<br />
Nor bothers any one by litigation.<br />
And, if a bet you’d have, you’ve nought to do,<br />
But give it <i>Crock</i>, and, with it, <i>sovereigns two</i>;<br />
You’ll quickly, if you win it, touch the treasure,<br />
For <i>Crock</i> (unlike some legs) dubs up with pleasure.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Crockford was indicted on several occasions, and by
different persons, for his share in the nuisance of the public
gaming-house in King Street; but his policy always led him
to a settlement of the matter with the prosecutor, in preference
to the risk of imprisonment and the treadmill.</p>

<p>On one occasion an indictment was preferred, and a true
bill found against him and others, for keeping the before-mentioned
house; and it was not without difficulty and
delay, creative of direful alarm, that the matter could be
arranged so as to prevent the parties being brought to trial.</p>

<p>The prosecutor was a person known as Baron d’A&mdash;&mdash;,
who formerly held a commission in the German Legion.
This gentleman had been desperate, and, of course, unfortunate
in his speculation at <i>rouge et noir</i>; and, at last, lost not
only his pay, but the proceeds of the sale of his commission.
Thus reduced, he became equally desperate in determination,
and occasionally made demands and levied contributions
from the parties who had won from him, but, compliance
with such demands becoming less frequent and less willing,
he resorted to the process of indictment, and made Crockford
one of the objects of his attack. On the true bill being
found, Crockford put in the necessary bail; between the
period of which and the day appointed for trial, communication
was opened with the baron, with a view to amicable
settlement and non-appearance of the prosecutor on the day
of trial; but in the negotiation Crockford’s party relied too
much on the poverty and distress of the baron, believing
that the griping hand of necessity would oblige him to
accept any offered sum to relieve his wants. Under such
belief an inconsiderable amount was tendered, but refused.
The baron had, fortunately for him, met with a shrewd
adviser, who persuaded him to hold out against any overtures
short of a handsome consideration; and he did so,
notwithstanding the fact that a considerable advance had
been made on the original sum offered to him.</p>

<p>The eve of trial approached, and Crockford’s alarm was
great. At length came the eventful day of his appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
at Clerkenwell Sessions. What was to be done? Incarceration
and hard labour stared him in the face, and with
them all the evil consequences connected with his absence
from his newly established club.</p>

<p>In this dilemma he sought the advice and active service
of Guy, his principal acting man in St James’s Street. This
man accompanied Crockford to the scene of trial, and, discovering
the baron in the precinct of the Court, contrived
to get into friendly conversation with him, a scheme which
led to some judicious hints on the impolicy of his longer
holding out against the liberal offer which he (Guy) had now
the authority to make from Crockford. Fortunately for the
latter the indictment was low down in the list of the day’s
business, and this gave opportunity to Guy to proceed more
leisurely in his designs. He prevailed on the baron to
accompany him to a tavern in the neighbourhood, and there,
under the influence of copious draughts of wine, an arrangement
was ultimately effected. The proposal, once entertained
by the baron, was not left to the chance of change,
nor was the baron permitted to consult with his adviser in
the matter; time was precious, the cause was approaching
its hearing, and at this crisis Guy called a coach, took from
his pocket a tempting sum, hurried the baron into the
vehicle, gave him the money, and never left him until he
had seen him on board a vessel bound for a foreign country.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the season 1821-22, luck went
against Crockford’s gaming establishment, and night after
night their capital decreased, so that, at last, it was with
difficulty they could supply the funds requisite for the night’s
bank. One night, their last £5000 was scraped together,
and they were all on wires; for an hour after play had commenced
£3000 had flown away. Crockford could stand it
no longer; he left the house, meditating whether he should
hang or drown himself: but scarcely was his back turned
than the run of luck changed, and, within two hours, the bank
had not only recovered their night’s loss, but a good round
sum besides. For the remainder of the season Fortune was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
in their favour, and, at its close, the proprietors had netted
over £200,000.</p>

<p>Crockford began building his new club house in St
James’s Street in 1827, and workmen were engaged on it
day and night. A huge ice house was dug which so affected
the Guard’s club house, which adjoined the northern end of
Crockford’s premises, that one entire side of it fell with a
crash, leaving the entire interior completely exposed to the
public gaze. There are two <i>bon mots</i> on the subject, preserved.</p>

<p class="ppsq6 p1">“‘What can the workmen be about?<br />
Do, Crockford, let the secret out,</p>
<p class="ppn8">Why thus our houses fall.</p>
<p class="ppn6">Quoth he, ‘Since folks are out of town,<br />
I find it better to pull down,</p>
<p class="ppn8">Than have no <i>pull at all</i>.’”</p>

<p class="ppq4 p1">“See, passenger, at Crockford’s high behest,<br />
<i>Red coats</i> by <i>black legs</i> ousted from their nest;<br />
The arts of peace o’ermatching reckless war,<br />
And gallant <i>rouge</i> outdone by wily <i>noir</i>.”</p>

<p class="p1">The Club was opened in the latter part of 1827 with a
great flourish of trumpets, and cards to view, which were
eagerly sought after by the <i>élite</i>. <i>The Times</i> of 1st Jan.
1828 gives an account of the royal displeasure at this Club,
which comes extremely <i>à propos</i> from the unsullied lips of
George IV. “<span class="smcap">Crockford’s Hell.</span> The establishment of
the Pandemonium in St James’s, under the entire superintendence
of the fishmonger and his unblushing patronizers,
lately called forth the opinion of the highest personage in
the kingdom, who expressed himself in a manner which
reflected the utmost credit on his head and heart. A
Nobleman of some standing at Court, in answer to a question
from his royal master, denied, in the most unequivocal
way, having become a subscriber to this splendid temple of
vice. The monarch evinced his satisfaction at the intelligence,
and, in his usual nervous style, denounced such
infamous receptacles for plunder, as not only a disgrace to
the country at large, but the age in which we live.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>The number of members belonging to the Club was from
1000 to 1200, exclusive of the privilege, or right of entrée
permitted to ambassadors and foreigners of distinction
during their diplomatic sojourn, or temporary visit, to this
country, and the Duke of Wellington, although he did not
gamble, was one of the earliest members. The annual subscription
was twenty-five pounds, and, for this, the members
had the most luxurious club of its time, with wines and
viands at a very low rate, although the latter were presided
over by the celebrated <i>chef</i>, Ude, to whom Crockford paid a
salary of £1200! The <i>Annual Register</i>, for 1834, tells a
very amusing story of Ude in connection with Crockford’s
Club.</p>

<p>“On July 25 M. Eustache Ude, the celebrated French
cook, appeared at Bow Street on a summons at the suit of
the Marquess of Queensberry, for unlawfully disposing of
certain birds called ‘red game,’ between the 19th of March
and the 1st of August, contrary to the provisions of the
Game Laws.</p>

<p>“Sir Roger Griesley deposed that he was a member of
Crockford’s Club House, and one of the managing committee
of that establishment. The defendant was cook there, and,
on the 19th of June, witness dined at the Club house, and
saw grouse served in the room, but did not partake of it.</p>

<p>“<i>M. Ude</i>: Vell, my dear Sare Rojer, vat is all dis to me?
Certainement you must know dat I don’t know vat de devil
goes up into de dining room. How de devil can I tell
veder black game, or vite game, or red game go up to de
dining room? Dere is plenty of game always go on in de
house, but dat is nothing to me. My only business is to
cook for de palates of dose who like de game.</p>

<p><i>Sir Roger Griesley</i>: I really don’t know what, in common
justice, M. Ude can have to do in this matter. He is the
cook of the establishment, certainly, but he only prepares
what is ordered. The Committee order the things, and he
provides according to that order.</p>

<p>“<i>M. Ude</i>: Tank you, my dear Sare Rojer. I knew you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
vould get me out of de scrape vot de noble marquis has got
me into dis time.</p>

<p>“<i>Charles, Marquess of Queensberry, sworn</i>: I was a
member of the Committee at Crockford’s, but am not now.
I was at Crockford’s on the 19th, and dined, and grouse was
served at the table.</p>

<p>“<i>M. Ude</i>: But, my noble friend (great laughter), as I said
to my friend Sare Rojer, I know noting at all about vot
vent into de room. I never sawed it at all. De orders are
given to me. I send my people to de butcher, and to de
poulterer, and to de fishmonger, and de tings are brought, and
I command dem to be cooked, and dey are cooked, and dat
is all I know about it.</p>

<p>“<i>Sir F. Roe</i>: Whether you know it, or not, the Act of
Parliament makes you liable.</p>

<p>“<i>M. Ude</i>: Upon my honour dat is very hard. Ven I
got de summons I remonstrated vid my Lord Alvanley, and
he say, ‘Oh, never mind, Ude, say dey vere pigeons, instead
of grouse.’ ‘Ah, my lord,’ say I, ‘I can not do better dan
dem pigeons, because dat bird is so common in dis house.’
(Loud Laughter).</p>

<p>“<i>Sir F. Roe</i>, who appeared greatly to enjoy the scene, said
he must, upon the oaths of the noble marquess and Sir
Roger Griesley, convict the defendant; but he should, certainly,
put the lowest penalty, namely 5s.</p>

<p>“<i>M. Ude</i>: Vel, I shall pay de money, but it is dam hard.
Ve have always game in our house, and de poor devil of a
cook have to pay de penalty for it. (Great laughter).”</p>

<p>The following is a contemporary description of this
palatial establishment.</p>

<p>“On entering from the street, a magnificent vestibule and
staircase break upon the view; to the right and left of the
hall are reading and dining rooms. The staircase is of a
sinuous form, sustained in its landing by four columns of the
Doric order, above which are a series of examples of the
Ionic order, forming a quadrangle with apertures to the chief
apartments. Above the pillars is a covered ceiling, perforated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
with luminous panels of stained glass, from which
springs a dome of surpassing beauty: from the dome
depends a lantern containing a magnificent chandelier.</p>

<p>“<i>The State Drawing Room</i> next attracts attention, a most
noble apartment, baffling perfect description of its beauty,
but decorated in the most florid style of Louis Quatorze.
The room presents a series of panels containing subjects, in
the style of Watteau, from the pencil of Mr Martin, a relative
of the celebrated historical painter of that name:
these panels are alternated with splendid mirrors. A chandelier
of exquisite workmanship hangs from the centre of
the ceiling, and three large tables, beautifully carved and
gilded, and covered with rich blue and crimson velvet, are
placed in different parts of the room. The upholstery and
decorative adjuncts are imitative of the gorgeous taste of
George the Fourth. Royalty can scarcely be conceived to
vie with the style and consummate splendour of this magnificent
chamber.</p>

<p>“<i>The lofty and capacious Dining Room</i>, supported by
marble pillars, and furnished in the most substantial and
aristocratic style of comfort, is equal to any arrangement of
the kind in the most lordly mansions.</p>

<p>“<i>The Drawing Room</i> is allowed to be one of the most
elegant apartments in the kingdom.</p>

<p>“<i>The Sanctum Sanctorum</i>, or <i>Play Room</i>, is comparatively
small, but handsomely furnished. In the centre of the
apartment stands the <i>all attractive Hazard Table</i>, innocent
and unpretending enough in its form and appearance, but
fatally mischievous and destructive in its conjunctive influence
with box and dice. On this table, it may, with truth,
be asserted that the greater portion, if not the whole of
Crockford’s immense wealth was achieved; and for this
piece of plain, unassuming mahogany, he had, doubtless, a
more profound veneration than for the most costly piece
of furniture that ever graced a palace. This bench of business
is large, and of oval shape, well stuffed, and covered
with fine green cloth, marked with yellow lines, denoting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
different departments of speculation. Round these compartments
are double lines, similarly marked, for the odds, or
proportions, between what is technically known as the <i>main</i>
and <i>chance</i>. In the centre, on each side, are indented positions
for the croupiers, or persons engaged at the table in
calling the main and chance, regulating the stakes, and paying
and receiving money, as the events decisive of gain and
loss occur. Over the table is suspended a three light lamp,
conveniently shaded, so as to show its full luminous power
on the cloth, and, at the same time, to protect the eyes of
the croupiers from the light’s too strong effect. At another
part of the room is fixed a writing table, or desk, where the
Pluto of the place was wont to preside, to mete out loans on
draft or other security, and to answer all demands by successful
players. Chairs of easy make, dice boxes, bowls for
holding counters representing sums from £1 to £200, with
small hand rakes used by players to draw their counters
from any inconvenient distance on the table, may be said to
complete the furniture, machinery, and implements of this
<i>great workshop</i>.”</p>

<p>It is said that during the first two seasons Crockford must
have netted about £300,000, but his expenses were heavy,
the item of dice alone (at about a guinea a pair) was £2000
per annum; three new pairs being provided for the opening
play each night, and very often as many more called for by
players, or put down by Crockford himself with a view to
change a player’s luck.</p>

<p>Crockford was bound by his agreement with his committee
to put down a bank, or capital, of £5000, nightly,
<i>during the sitting of Parliament</i>, and he was not permitted
to terminate the play until a stated hour, as long as any of
that £5000 remained.</p>

<p>He died at his mansion in Carlton House Terrace, on
25 May 1844, aged 69. He died a very wealthy man,
although he experienced very heavy losses in sundry speculations.
A contemporary says of him:</p>

<p>“The entire property amassed by Mr Crockford must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
have been immense, regard being had to the fact that,
exclusively of a sum of money, amounting to nearly half a
million sterling, bequeathed to his widow, he is confidently
reported to have distributed amongst his children, about
two years ago, a sum nearly equalling, if not exceeding that
amount: a circumstance not at all improbable in a man
of foresight, like Mr Crockford, and one which will fully
account, as well for the bequest of the whole bulk of his
remaining fortune to his widow, as for such bequest being
absolute, and free from all condition. In estimating the
wealth acquired by Mr Crockford through the medium and
success of his French hazard bank (for this was the never-failing
source of gain), there must be taken into account the
heavy and extravagant expenditure of the establishment
in St James’s Street; his own expensive, though by no
means foolishly extravagant, mode of living; the maintenance
and education of a very numerous family, the advances
of money from time to time, made to fit them out
and further their prospects in life; the expense of a racing
stud; a considerable outlay in suppressing various indictments
preferred against him for his former proprietorship in
King Street, and the heavy losses more recently sustained
by other venture and speculation. It may be fairly calculated
that the certain profits of the hazard table must
have embraced millions! and some idea may be formed of
the extent of evil to others consequent on such an accumulation
of capital extracted from their means.”</p>

<p>Captain Gronow<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> gives us a very graphic description of
this club, drawn from the life, for he was a member
thereof.</p>

<p>“I have alluded, in my first volume, to the high play
which took place at White’s and Brookes’s in the olden
time, and at Wattier’s in the days of Brummel and the
dandies. Charles Fox, George Selwyn, Lord Carlisle, Fitzpatrick,
Horace Walpole, the Duke of Queensberry, and
others, lost whole fortunes at faro, macao and hazard;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
almost the only winners, indeed, of that generation were
General Scott, father-in-law of Canning, the Duke of Portland,
and Lord Robert Spencer; Lord Robert, indeed,
bought the beautiful estate of Woolbidding, in Sussex, with
the proceeds of his gains by keeping the bank at Brookes’s.</p>

<p>“But in the reign of George IV. a new star rose upon the
horizon in the person of Mr William Crockford; and the
old-fashioned game of faro, macao and lansquenet gave
place to the all-devouring thirst for the game of hazard.
Crockey, when still a young man, had relinquished the
peaceful trade of a fishmonger for a share in a “hell,”
where, with his partner Gye, he managed to win, after
a sitting of twenty-four hours, the enormous sum of one
hundred thousand pounds from Lords Thanet and Granville,
Mr Ball Hughes, and two other gentlemen whose
names I do not now remember. With this capital added
to his former gains, he built the well known palace in St
James’s Street, where a club was established, and play
organised, on a scale of magnificence and liberality hitherto
unknown in Europe.</p>

<p>“One may safely say, without exaggeration, that Crockford
won the whole of the ready money of the then existing
generation. As is often the case at Lord’s cricket ground,
the great match of the gentlemen of England against the
professional players was won by the latter. It was a very
hollow thing, and in a very few years twelve hundred
thousand pounds were swept away by the fortunate fishmonger.
He did not, however, die worth more than a
sixth part of this vast sum; the difference being swallowed
up in various unlucky speculations.</p>

<p>“No one can describe the splendour and excitement of
the early days of Crockey. A supper of the most exquisite
kind, prepared by the famous Ude, and accompanied by
the best wines in the world, together with every luxury of
the season, was furnished gratis. The members of the club
included all the celebrities of England, from the Duke of
Wellington, to the youngest Ensign of the Guards; and, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
the gay and festive board, which was constantly replenished
from midnight to early dawn, the most brilliant sallies of
wit, the most agreeable conversation, the most interesting
anecdotes, interspersed with grave political discussions and
acute logical reasoning on every conceivable subject, proceeded
from the soldiers, scholars, statesmen, poets and men
of pleasure, who, when the ‘house was up,’ and balls and
parties at an end, delighted to finish their evening with a
little supper, and a good deal of hazard at old Crockey’s.
The tone of the club was most excellent. A most gentlemanlike
feeling prevailed, and none of the rudeness, familiarity
and ill breeding which disgrace some of the minor
clubs of the present day, would have been tolerated for a
moment.</p>

<p>“Though not many years have elapsed since the time of
which I write, the supper table had a very different appearance
from what it would present, did the club now exist.
Beards were completely unknown, and the rare mustachios
were only worn by officers of the Household Brigade, or
hussar regiments. Stiff white neckcloths, blue coats and
brass buttons, rather short waisted white waistcoats, and
tremendously embroidered shirt fronts, with gorgeous studs
of great value, were considered the right thing. A late
deservedly popular Colonel in the Guards used to give Storr
&amp; Mortimer £25 a year, to furnish him with a new set of
studs every Saturday night during the London season.</p>

<p>“The great foreign diplomatists, Prince Talleyrand, Count
Pozzo di Borgo, General Alava, the Duke of Palmella, Prince
Esterhazy, the French, Russian, Spanish, Portuguese, and
Austrian ambassadors, and all persons of distinction and
eminence who arrived in England, belonged to Crockford’s
as a matter of course; but many rued the day when they
became members of that fascinating but dangerous <i>coterie</i>.
The great Duke himself, always rather a friend of the
dandies, did not disdain to appear now and then at this
charming club; whilst the late Lord Raglan, Lord Anglesey,
Sir Hussey Vivian, and many more of our Peninsula and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Waterloo heroes, were constant visitors. The two great
novelists of the day, who have since become great statesmen,
Disraeli and Bulwer Lytton, displayed at that brilliant
supper-table, the one his sable, the other his auburn curls;
there Horace Twiss made proof of an appetite, and Edward
Montague of a thirst, which astonished all beholders; whilst
the bitter jests of Sir Joseph Copley, Colonel Armstrong, and
John Wilson Croker, and the brilliant wit of Alvanley, were
the delight of all present, and their <i>bon mots</i> were the next
day retailed all over England.</p>

<p>“In the play-room might be heard the clear ringing voice
of that agreeable reprobate, Tom Duncombe, as he cheerfully
called ‘Seven,’ and the powerful hand of the vigorous Sefton
in throwing for a ten. There might be noted the scientific
dribbling of a four by ‘King’ Allen, the tremendous backing
of nines and fives by Ball Hughes and Auriol, the
enormous stakes played for by Lords Lichfield and Chesterfield,
George Payne, Sir St Vincent Cotton, D’Orsay, and
George Anson, and, above all, the gentlemanly bearing and
calm and unmoved demeanour, under losses or gains, of all
the men of that generation.</p>

<p>“The old fishmonger himself, seated snug and sly at his
desk in the corner of the room, watchful as the dragon that
guarded the golden apples of the Hesperides, would only
give credit to good and approved signatures. Who that
ever entered that dangerous little room can ever forget the
large green table, with the croupiers, Page, Darking, and
Bacon, with their suave manners, sleek appearance, stiff
white neck cloths, and the almost miraculous quickness and
dexterity with which they swept away the money of the
unfortunate punters when the fatal cry of ‘Deuce ace,’
‘Aces,’ or ‘Sixes out,’ was heard in answer to the caster’s
bold cry of ‘Seven,’ or ‘Nine,’ or ‘Five’s the main.’</p>

<p>“<i>O noctes cœnæque deûm!</i> but the brightest medal has its
reverse, and after all the wit and gaiety and excitement of
the night, how disagreeable the waking up, and how very
unpleasant the sight of the little card, with its numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
figures marked down on the debtor side in the fine bold
hand of Mr Page. Alas, poor Crockey’s! shorn of its
former glory, has become a sort of refuge for the destitute,
a cheap dining-house.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> How are the mighty fallen! Irish
buckeens, spring captains, ‘welchers’ from Newmarket,
and suspicious looking foreigners, may be seen swaggering
after dinner through the marble halls, and up that gorgeous
staircase where once the chivalry of England loved to congregate;
and those who remember Crockford’s in all its
glory, cast, as they pass, a look of unavailing regret at its
dingy walls, with many a sigh to the memory of the pleasant
days they passed there, and the gay companions and noble
gentlemen who have long since gone to their last home.”</p>

<p>One more story about Crockford’s, told by Sir George
Chetwynd,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> and I have done with this subject. Speaking
of Mr George Payne, he says: “Many were the stories he
told of his early life, of his hunting, of the enormous sum he
lost on the Leger before he came of age, of his never seeing
daylight for a whole week in one winter, owing to being
challenged by a friend to play a certain number of games at
écarté, which resulted in their playing every night for six days
till seven o’clock in the morning. Of course it was dark then
at that season, and he used not to get up till 3.30 to 4
o’clock. He was fond of describing Crockford’s when the
conversation turned on hazard or cards, and used to speak
of the lavish way in which the old fishmonger supplied his
guests (or victims) with the finest hot-house peaches, grapes,
and every conceivable delicacy that could be obtained for
money, and all this gratis. A number of men who did not
care to play at hazard, used purposely to lose a hundred or
two a year at the tables, to have the pleasure of dining and
supping with their friends, who all flocked to the magnificent
rooms, which, at night, presented the appearance of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
luxurious club. Mr Payne used to narrate that, after
dinner, he would sometimes stroll round there early, and,
finding hardly anyone there except Crockford at his desk,
used to sit down and play a game of backgammon with him,
both being fine players.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="pch">Hells in the Quadrant, 1833&mdash;Smith <i>v.</i> Bond&mdash;Police powers&mdash;“Confessions of
a Croupier.”</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="beg">The</span> West End of London literally swarmed with gambling
houses, for the most part of a very different description from
Crockford’s, as may be seen by the two following quotations
from <i>The Times</i>, Jan. 24, 1833:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pc1 mid">“<span class="smcap">The Hells in the Quadrant.</span></p>

<p class="p1">“Those seats of vice (the gaming-houses) which for some
time past have existed in the Quadrant, appear to be done
up, as, since Saturday, not one of them has been opened.
Since the five persons have been apprehended, the visitors
have been extremely scarce; nor was their confidence restored,
even by the proprietors having the chain up at the
street door, coupled with a fellow’s being employed at each
of the hells, to patrol before the different establishments,
for the purpose of giving the requisite information as to who
sought admission into those dens of destruction. Although
a very active search has been made for the purpose of
ascertaining what has become of Daly, the clerk of the
Athenæum Club-house, who left that establishment on the
8th instant, no trace had been found of him&mdash;one of the
many lamentable cases of loss of character and ruin which
overtake those who suffer themselves to be lured into those
houses. Daly, who enjoyed the confidence of the whole of
the members, was suddenly missed on the above day. On
looking over his papers, a diary was found, from which it
appeared that he had lost large sums of money at No. 60,
and, as it has since been ascertained he was there on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
previous day, it is supposed that he lost twenty-four £5
notes, at play, which belonged to his employers. Upon this
discovery being made, some gentlemen of the Athenæum
waited on the parish officers, to ascertain whether they
could not put a stop to the gaming-houses. It was, however,
found that it could not be done unless some person
would come forward and identify those at play; a relation
of Daly accordingly went to the house and supplied the
necessary proof. It was at this establishment, a few months
since, the foreigners who had been fleeced made an attempt
to rob the bank; and, shortly after that, placards were
posted on the walls in the neighbourhood of the Quadrant,
cautioning persons from going into any of the hells, as
drugged wine was invariably given to those who were going
to play.”</p>

<p>May 9th: “Three prisoners, out of six, answered to the
indictment of keeping and maintaining a common gaming-house,
and pleaded guilty. The prosecuting counsel, Mr
Clarkson, said that the house in question was situate No. 4
Regent’s Circus, six doors from the house which was lately
prosecuted. He should have been able to prove that on
February the 7th, 9th, 12th, and 14th last, the games of
<i>rouge et noir</i> and <i>roulette</i> were played for sums varying from
one sovereign to one shilling. He should also have proved
that on some one, or on all those occasions, the defendants
acted in the capacities of doorkeeper, banker, and waiter.
He (Mr Clarkson) was informed by the officers of St James’s
parish, that, at the last Sessions there were twenty-seven
houses of this description situate therein, and out of that
number only two had been closed in the interval, but three
new ones had been opened, so that the number had been
increased rather than otherwise.</p>

<p>“Mr Phillips, for the defence, said that those houses had
nothing to do with the present case. He would advise the
parish officers to go to Crockford’s, not far distant from the
house in question, where they would find lords and peers of
the realm at play.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>“The bench sentenced two of the prisoners to three
months’, and one to fourteen days’ imprisonment, in the
House of Correction, whilst the bail of one who did not
appear was estreated.”</p>

<p>Of the hells in London in 1833, we get a very fair
notion in a long article in <i>Fraser’s Magazine</i> for August of
that year, from which I take the following small portion:&mdash;</p>

<p>“On an average, during the last twenty years, about
thirty hells have been regularly open in London for the
accommodation of the lowest and most vile set of hazard
players. The game of hazard is the principal one played
at the low houses, and is, like the characters who play it,
the most desperate and ruinous of all games. The wretched
men who follow this play are partial to it, because it gives a
chance, from a run of good luck, to become speedily possessed
of all the money on the table: no man who plays
hazard ever despairs of making his fortune at some time.
Such is the nature of this destructive game, that I can now
point out several men, whom you see daily, who were in
rags and wretchedness on Monday, and, before the termination
of the week, they ride in a newly-purchased Stanhope
of their own, having several thousand pounds in their possession.
The few instances of such successes which, unfortunately,
occur, are generally well-known, and, consequently,
encourage the hopes of others, who nightly attend these
places, sacrificing all considerations of life to the carrying (if
it only be a few shillings) their all, every twenty-four hours,
to stake in this great lottery, under the delusive hope of
catching Dame Fortune, at some time, in a merry mood.
Thousands annually fall, in health, fame, and fortune, by
this maddening infatuation, whilst not one in a thousand
finds an oasis in the desert.</p>

<p>“The inferior houses of play are always situated in
obscure courts, or other places of retirement, and, most
frequently, are kept shut up during the day as well as at
night, as if unoccupied, or some appearance of trade is
carried on as a blind. A back room is selected for all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
operations, if one can be procured sufficiently capacious for
the accommodation of forty or fifty persons at one time.
In the centre of the room is fixed a substantial circular
table, immoveable to any power of pressure against it by
the company who go to play; a circle of inlaid white holly
wood is formed in the middle of the table of about four feet
diameter, and a lamp is suspended immediately over this
ring. A man, designated the Groom Porter, is mounted on
a stool, with a stick in his hand, having a transverse piece
of wood affixed to its end, which is used by him to rake in
the dice after having been thrown out of the box by the
caster (the person who throws the dice).</p>

<p>“The avowed profits of keeping a table of this kind is the
receipt of a piece for each <i>box hand</i>,&mdash;that is, when a player
wins three times successively, he pays a certain sum to the
table, and there is an aperture in the table made to receive
these contributions. At the minor establishments, the price
of a <i>box hand</i> varies from a shilling to half-a-crown, according
to the terms on which the house is known to have been
originally opened. If there is much play, these payments
produce ample profits to the keeper of the house; but their
remuneration for running the risk of keeping an unlawful
table of play, is plunder.</p>

<p>“At all these houses, as at the higher ones, there is always
a set of men who are dependent on the keepers of the house,
who hang about the table like sharks for prey, waiting for
those who stay late, or are inebriated, and come in towards
morning to play when there are but few lookers on; unfair
means are then resorted to with impunity, and all share the
plunder. About eleven o’clock, when all honest and regular
persons are preparing for rest, the play commences, the adventurers
being seated around the table: one takes the box
and dice, putting what he is disposed to play for into the
ring marked on the table; as soon as it is covered with a
like sum, or set, as it is termed, by another person, the
player calls a main, and at the same moment throws the dice;
if the number called comes up, the caster wins; but if any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
other main comes uppermost on the dice the thrower takes
that chance for his own, and his adversary has the one he
called; the throwing then continues, during which bets are
made by others on the event until it is decided. If the
caster throws deuce ace, or aces, when he first calls a main,
it is said to be crabbed, and he loses; but if he throws the
number named he is said to have nicked it, and thereby
wins it. Also, if he should call six or eight, and throws the
double sixes he wins; or, if seven be the number called, and
eleven is thrown, it is a nick, because those chances are nicks
to these mains; which regulation is necessary to the equalisation
of all the chances of this game when calling a main.
The odds against any number being thrown against another
varies from two to one to six to five, and, consequently,
keeps all the table engaged in betting. All bets are staked,
and the noise occasioned by proposing and accepting wagers
is most uproarious and deafening among the low players,
each having one eye on the black spots marked on the dice
as they land from the box, and the other on the stakes,
ready to snatch it if successful. To prevent the noise being
heard in the streets, shutters, closely fitted to the window
frames, are affixed, which are padded and covered with green
baize: there is, invariably, an inner door placed in the passage,
having an aperture in it, through which all who enter
the door from the street may be viewed; this precaution
answers two purposes, it deadens the sound of noisy
voices at the table and prevents surprise by the officers of
justice.</p>

<p>“The generality of the minor gambling houses are kept by
prize-fighters and other desperate characters, who bully and
hector the more timid out of their money by deciding that
bets have been lost, when, in fact, they have been won.
Bread, cheese and beer are supplied to the players, and a
glass of gin is handed, when called for, gratis. To these
places thieves resort, and such other loose characters as are
lost to every feeling of honesty and shame: a table of this
nature in full operation is a terrific sight; all the bad passions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
appertaining to the vicious propensities of mankind are
portrayed on the countenances of the players.</p>

<p>“An assembly of the most horrible demons could not exhibit
a more appalling effect; recklessness and desperation
overshadow every noble trait which should enlighten the
countenance of a human being. Many, in their desperation,
strip themselves, on the spot, of their clothes, either to stake
against money or to pledge to the table keeper for a trifle to
renew their play: and many instances occur of men going
home half naked, having lost their all.</p>

<p>“They assemble in parties of from forty to fifty persons,
who probably bring, on an average, each night, from one to
twenty shillings to play with. As the money is lost the
players depart, if they cannot borrow or beg more; and this
goes on sometimes in the winter season, for fourteen to sixteen
hours in succession; so that from 100 to 140 persons
may be calculated to visit one gambling table in the course
of a night; and it not unfrequently happens that, ultimately,
all the money brought to the table gets into the hands
of one or two of the most fortunate adventurers, save that
which is paid to the table for box hands; whilst the losers
separate only to devise plans by which a few more shillings
may be procured for the next night’s play. Every man so
engaged is destined either to become, by success, a more
finished and mischievous gambler, or to appear at the bar of
the Old Bailey, where, indeed, most of them may be said to
have figured already.</p>

<p>“The successful players, by degrees, improve their external
appearance, and obtain admission into houses of higher play,
where 2s. 6d. or 3s. 4d. is demanded for the box hands. At
these places silver counters are used, representing the aliquot
parts of a pound; these are called <i>pieces</i>, one of which is a
box hand. If success attends them in the first step of
advancement, they next become initiated into Crown houses,
and associate with gamblers of respectable exterior; where,
if they show talents, they either become confederates in
forming schemes of plunder, and in aiding establishments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
to carry on their concerns in defiance of the law, or fall back
to their old station of playing <i>chicken hazard</i>, as the small
play is designated.”</p>

<p>And so things went on for ten years longer, until the
scandal was too grievous to be borne, and a Select Committee
sat in Parliament, in 1844, on the subject of gaming.
This was principally brought about by the revelations in the
case of <i>Smith</i> v. <i>Bond</i>, which was tried before Lord Abinger
and a special jury at the Middlesex Sittings after Michaelmas
Term, 1842. It was a common gaming-house case
brought under the statute of Anne (9th, c. 14), which was
enacted to repress excessive gaming.</p>

<p>The parish of St George’s, Hanover Square, swarmed with
hells, and the efforts of the parish officers had hitherto been
unable to put them down. The play at such houses was
notoriously unfair, and the keepers had thriven in proportion
to the number and wealth of the victims they had been able
to fleece. It was therefore resolved to bring an action under
this statute, which not only prohibits excessive gaming, but
enables the loser of above £10 at a sitting, to recover treble
the amount of his losses; or, if he does not choose to take
this course himself, any informer is enabled to sue for and
obtain the penalty, one half of which is to benefit the poor
of the parish in which the offence was committed, and the
other half is to go to the person bringing the action.</p>

<p>In the case tried before Lord Abinger, the gaming-house
went by the name of the Minor St James’s Club-house; but
there was not the least pretence for calling it a club; anybody
went there to play with hardly the formality of a first
introduction. The keepers did a thriving trade, at French
Hazard chiefly, and it was proved by the plaintiff, who had
been one of the coterie who kept the table, that Mr Bredell had
lost £200, Mr Fitzroy Stanhope £50, the Marquis of Conyngham
£500 on each of two separate occasions, Lord Cantalupe
£400, and other noblemen and gentlemen various sums.</p>

<p>An ingenious plea was put in by counsel on behalf of
Bond, the keeper of the so-called club, that the sums in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
question were paid by cheques, and as a cheque is not held
to be a payment in law until cashed, and as the banks at
which the cheques were payable were not in the parish of
St George’s, Hanover Square, the offence was not completed
in that parish, and the plaintiff could not recover. The
Chief Baron overruled the objection, and under his direction
the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff for £3508, being
treble the amount actually proved to have been lost, thus
teaching a very useful lesson to the keepers of gaming-houses
generally. Had Lords Conyngham and Cantalupe
and Mr Stanhope come forward as witnesses, and certified
to their losses on the two occasions mentioned, additional
penalties would have accrued to the amount of £5820.</p>

<p>The Act of 1822 (3 Geo. IV., c. 114) was still in force,
by which a gaming-house keeper might be imprisoned with
hard labour, and the Police Act of 1839 (2 and 3 Vic., c.
47, § 48) provided that “it shall be lawful for the Commissioners,
by Order in Writing, to authorize the Superintendent
to enter any such House, or Room, with such Constables
as shall be directed by the Commissioners to accompany
him, and, if necessary, to use Force for the Purpose of effecting
such Entry, whether by breaking open Doors, or otherwise,
and to take into Custody all Persons who shall be
found therein, and to seize and destroy all Tables and
Instruments of gaming found in such House, or Premises;
and, also, to seize all Monies and Securities for Money found
therein, and the Owner, or Keeper of the said Gaming-House,
or other person having the Care and Management
thereof; and, also, every Banker, Croupier, and other Person
who shall act in any manner in conducting the said
Gaming-House, shall be liable to a Penalty of not more than
One Hundred Pounds; or, in the discretion of the Magistrate
before whom he shall be convicted of the Offence, may be
committed to the House of Correction, with or without hard
Labour, for a Time not more than Six Calendar Months;
and, upon Conviction of any such Offender, all the Monies
and Securities for Monies, which shall have been seized, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
aforesaid, shall be paid to the said Receiver, to be, by him,
applied towards defraying the Charge of the Police of the
Metropolis; and every Person found in such Premises,
without lawful Excuse, shall be liable to a Penalty of not
more than Five Pounds.”</p>

<p>But all this legislation was of no use; the gaming-tables
continued to flourish until after the Report of the Select
Committee. What they were like at that time may best be
learnt by the following extract from an article in <i>Bentley’s
Magazine</i> for June 1844, entitled “A Fashionable Gaming-house,
Confessions of a Croupier.”</p>

<p>“The&mdash;&mdash; gaming-house,&mdash;&mdash; Street, some years ago,
was kept by three well-known individuals. After passing
through two lobbies you entered the play-room, which
formed a <i>coup d’œil</i> of no ordinary attraction. It was a
large room, richly carpeted. Two rich and massive
chandeliers, suspended from the ceiling, showed the dazzling
gilt and colour of the empanelled walls; from which, at
alternate distances, extended elegant mirror branches with
lights. The chimney piece was furnished with a plate of
glass, which reached the ceiling, the sides were concealed by
falling drapery of crimson and gold, and supported by two
gilt full-length figures bearing lights. At the opposite end
were placed two <i>beaufets</i>, furnished with costly plate, glass,
etc. In the middle was fixed the hazard table, of a long
oval form, having an adumbrated lamp hanging over the
centre. On the right stood the <i>rouge et noir</i> and <i>roulette</i>
tables, idly placed, ‘to make up a show.’ Not so that on
the left, for, there, stood the supper table. This was laid
out with viands worthy the contemplation of an epicure, on
whitest damask, in costly china, and in forms delicate and
<i>recherché</i>. Everything which might court the most fastidious
taste was there spread in luxuriant profusion; game, poultry,
ham, tongue, not forgetting the substantial sirloin; lobster
salads, oysters, <i>en outre les petites misères</i>; confectionery
and preserves; creams, jellies, and pine apples. Silver
candelabra lighted each end of this long and well supplied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
table, while the middle was reserved for the display of one
of still greater magnificence, said to have been designed and
executed for his Royal Highness, the late Duke of&mdash;&mdash;.
It was composed of a large figure of Hercules contending
with the Hydra with seven heads. This gorgeous piece of
plate supported seven wax lights. Iolaus (who assisted
Hercules) was, also, represented, bearing the lighted brand
wherewith to staunch the blood, lest another head should
spring from the wound.”</p>

<p>This is much; but when to this is added&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppn6 p1">‘Something, still, which prompts the eternal sigh!’</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">One Thousand Sovereigns!</span> a shining golden heap!
and <span class="smcap">Ten Thousand Pounds</span> in notes! the reader may
imagine the scene which every evening met the eye. Yes!
every evening, into a silver vase, which stood on the hazard
table, were emptied ten bags, each containing one hundred
sovereigns!</p>

<p>On some evenings, there would, perhaps, be no play, and
insufferably tedious would have been the hours from eleven
till three but for the relief offered by some tragi-comic
incident. The London season was about to open; the
Newmarket Spring Meeting had just closed, and Tattersall’s,
consequently, exhibited a slight gathering. The members
of Crockford’s, as yet, presented a meagre attendance; the
Opera Bills announced attractive novelties, and the minor
theatres promised their many marvels. In fact, the busy,
bustling hive of human interests was on the move. The
dormant began to stir, the watchful to speculate; the beauty
to take her promenade in the yet pale sunshine; the invalid
to snatch his walk at the meridian hour; the gambler to
devise his means of expense, and the banker-hell-keeper how
to frustrate them.</p>

<p>It was one evening, about this period, that a party entered
to try the fortune of an hour. The result of the evening’s
play was against the bank. One of the visitors won five
hundred pounds, which, for a whim, he took away in gold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
He tied the sovereigns up in a white pocket handkerchief,
threw them over his shoulder, and, in that manner, walked
up St James’s Street. From that night, the same party continued
to visit us; and, with occasional droppers in of ex-colonels,
majors, captains, etc., we, generally, made up a
table. What! enter again, after having won five hundred
pounds! ‘Oh! infatuated man,’ I hear the reader exclaim.
Yes! for of all things unfathomable and absorbing, there is
nothing so unfathomably deep as the desires of the human
heart, when stimulated by the excitement of speculation.</p>

<p>For some weeks the play had been constant, and, as the
season advanced, the company increased, and the money
began to return to the bank. Sometimes play began late,
perhaps not till after one.</p>

<p>Among our very constant visitors was a gallant captain.
He came early, and was good to lose a hundred pounds, and
satisfied to win fifty. His entrance was always met by a
ready welcome.</p>

<p>‘Here comes the gallant captain! How are you, captain?’</p>

<p>‘Hearty, thank ye!’ he replied. ‘I say, how was it that
my cheque was not paid this morning?’</p>

<p>‘Not paid! you’re joking, captain!’</p>

<p>‘Joking!’ replied the captain. ‘No, I’ll be d&mdash;d if
it is a joke.’</p>

<p>The captain, on the previous evening, having won, had
put up his counters and wished for a fifty pound note.</p>

<p>‘Certainly,’ said one of the triumvirs, looking into the
box. ‘A fifty, did you say, captain? I am sorry to say
I have not got a fifty. Make it a hundred, captain. You
will soon do it if you put it down a little spicy.’</p>

<p>‘No,’ rejoined the captain, ‘I don’t want to play any
more, for I must leave town early to-morrow morning.’</p>

<p>‘Well; but what is to be done?’ said the manager.
Then, calling to his partner, he inquired if he had a fifty
pound note for Captain&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>‘No, I have not; but I will write a cheque for him; that
will be all the same.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>Away went the captain, as light hearted as a cricket, to
sleep away the few remaining hours that intervened before
another day wakes us all to our divers duties. Who has
not noticed the punctuality of the banker’s clerks wending
their way to their daily toil. Not quite so early as these,
yet not much later, did the captain doff his night gear;
then made his appearance at the banker’s, nothing doubting.
He presents ‘the bit o’ writin’’ ‘Two twenties and ten in
gold.’ The clerk puts forward his attenuated fingers, examines
it: a pause ensues. How can it be? The date is
right, and the autograph is genuine; but there is no order
to pay it.</p>

<p>‘No order to pay it?’ echoed the captain, much
annoyed.</p>

<p>Between ourselves, the private mark was wanting: which
was, perhaps, a pin hole, or not a pin hole.</p>

<p>On the evening I have referred to, he received counters
for this cheque, and was, already, deep in the game, when
the <i>chef</i> made his appearance. The above <i>ruse</i> was frequently
resorted to.</p>

<p>It is customary to lend money to parties on cheque, or
otherwise, if the applicants are considered safe. One of the
visitors, who was passionately addicted to play and the turf,
having lost his ready money, borrowed three hundred pounds
in counters, and, having lost these also, gave a cheque for
the amount; but with this condition, that it should not be
sent in to his banker’s in the country for some few days.
No sooner, however, was his back turned than an <i>employé</i>
was instructed to start off very early the following morning
to get the cheque cashed; the date, which was left open,
being first clapped in. The cheque was paid; and two or
three nights afterwards the young gentleman came for an
explanation of the circumstance, and to remonstrate. The
poor <i>employé</i>, as usual, was made the scapegoat, and was
roundly abused for his stupidity in not understanding that
he was particularly ordered not to present it till further
notice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the practice, also, to present post-dated cheques,
which had been refused payment, and even to sue on them.
Sometimes, after an evening’s play, a gentleman would find
himself the winner of a couple of hundred pounds, when, all
but folding up the notes, and preparing to go, he would find,
to his mortification, a small account against him, of, perhaps,
seventy or eighty pounds. ‘Eighty pounds! impossible!
there must be some mistake.’ Expostulation was vain.
‘It is down in the book. It is perfectly correct, you may
rest assured. I pledge you my honour of this.’</p>

<p>Sometimes it happened that a gentleman would borrow
one hundred pounds, of course in counters, on a cheque or
a short bill. Perhaps he might win thirty or forty pounds,
in which case, the one hundred pounds in counters would
be taken from him and his cheque returned, and he would
be left to do his best with the small capital remaining to
him, with the privilege of renewing the transaction, should
he lose it. Counters, so borrowed, were not allowed to be
lent to a friend.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it may seem not a bad ‘hedge,’ technically
speaking, to have the opportunity of borrowing hundred
after hundred, as some people would do, till a hand came
off. I have known persons to come in without a penny,
and declare the Caster, in or out, ten pounds, and losing the
bet, would ask for a hundred pounds, would receive it and
lose it, and receive in the same way to the amount of six or
seven hundred pounds, and then would declare that they
would not pay one farthing unless accommodated with
another hundred. I have known a man of high rank lose
to the amount of fourteen hundred pounds, on account,
which, under the circumstances, his lordship had more sense
than to pay. But, for the bold style, I will quote a city
wine merchant. Having lost his cash, he requested a
hundred pounds, which he received; he then asked for
another, which he also received. He demanded another!
After a few words, and a reference to a friend then at the
table, this, too, was given to him, and a cheque for £300<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
was received for the advance made. It so happened that
the third hundred was lost also. He, then, peremptorily
demanded more, and, upon being refused, he requested to
see the cheque, disputing the amount, which being handed
to him, he immediately tore it to pieces, and left the room.</p>

<p class="ptb2 p1">······</p>

<p class="p1">It may be thought that a gentleman who has lost above
a thousand pounds in a gaming-house may have the right
of <i>entrée</i> by prescription. Nothing is more unlike the fact.
From the height of his prosperity to its declension, every
occultation in his course is noted with the nicest observation;
for instance, playing for lower stakes, a more febrile
excitement when losing, occasionally borrowing of a friend,
a cheque not punctually paid; and, finally, a small sum
borrowed of the bank, to enable him to take up a bill under
a very pressing emergency. These are the little circumstances
which lead to his ultimate exclusion. On some fine
evening during the ensuing season, he calls, thinking to be
admitted as heretofore; but he is stopped at the first door
with the ready excuse, that ‘there is nothing doing.’ On
the next call, he is told ‘there is no play going on.’</p>

<p>‘No play? So you said the last time I called; and I
have since understood from a friend that there was play.
Let me in; I want to see the manager.’</p>

<p>‘He is not in, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, very well, I shall take some other opportunity of
seeing him.’</p>

<p>When he does see the <i>chef</i>, the latter expresses most
sincere regret at the occurrence, and makes a most specious
promise to have the interdict removed. Thus assured, who
is now to oppose his entrance? Not the porter, surely!
Yes; the very same person still insists that the great man
is not within; that he knows nothing about the explanation
given, and, therefore, cannot admit him. Thus repulsed, the
applicant murmurs a threat about not paying, and thus ends
the matter.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="pch">Select Committee on Gaming, 1844&mdash;Evidence.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="beg">Such,</span> then, was gambling, when the Select Committee on
gaming sat in 1844, and Mr (afterwards Sir) Richard
Mayne, in his evidence, shows the craftiness of the gaming-house
keepers, and the difficulties of the police in obtaining
a conviction. He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Superintendent Baker was the Superintendent who
entered all those houses. With the permission of the
Committee, I will read his report, in which he states the
difficulties he has met with: ‘I beg, most respectfully,
to lay before the Commissioners a few observations for
their consideration, being extremely anxious that something
more should be done respecting the gaming-houses,
to put them down, which are the cause of so many young
men’s ruin, and, at the same time, show to the Commissioners
the difficulties I have to contend with, before an entry can
be effected; from the reluctance of the housekeepers to
make the required affidavits, from not wishing to have their
names brought forward in such matters; also, from the
great difficulty in gaining an entrance to a gaming-house,
from their extreme caution and watchfulness, besides the
strength of their doors and fastenings, which gives them
ample time to remove any implement of gaming from the
premises: their vigilance is such that it is impossible to
obtain an entry for the purpose of seeing play, unless
treachery is used with some of the players, which is attended
by danger and great expense. On the slightest alarm, the
cloths, which are thrown loose over a common table, &amp;c.,
are, in one moment, removed, and secreted about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
persons of the keepers, &amp;c.; and, as the present law stands,
the police are not empowered to search them at all: there
are no complaints from the housekeepers respecting the
gaming-houses, and, in every instance of putting them down,
the police have been obliged almost to compel them to go
to the police court to swear to the necessary affidavits;
such has been their reluctance. As the present law stands,
before I can enter a gaming-house with safety, I am obliged
to go through the following forms: 1st, to make such inquiry
as to leave no doubt that gaming is carried on in a house;
2nd, to make a report of the circumstance to the Commissioners;
3rd, to show the said report to the housekeepers
residing in the parish and neighbourhood where the house is
situated, and the offence carried on, for them to make the
necessary affidavits; 4th, to prepare affidavits for the housekeepers
to sign, in the presence of the magistrates; 5th, to
make a report of the same to the Commissioners when sworn
to; 6th, to make out the Commissioners’ warrant for me and
the police under my command to enter; 7th, to endeavour,
if possible, to get an officer in disguise into the gaming-house
to witness play being carried on, previous to my entry, which
is the most difficult task to encounter, as no one is admitted
unless brought there by a Bonnet or a play-man, as a
pigeon or freshman, commonly known as Punters or Flats.
Since my entry into No. 34 St James’s Street, kept by
Isaiah Smart, whose son was killed by a fall from the roof
in endeavouring to escape from the police, there is no doubt
the gamblers have exercised the greatest ingenuity in their
power in order to entrap me into a false entry on their
premises by lighting up the rooms as if play was going
on; employing persons to watch, both outside and in, to
give the alarm on the appearance of any of the police
passing; so that, if I was tempted to make an entry without
taking the precaution of having an officer inside to prove
gaming, there is not the least doubt but that they would
instantly catch at the opportunity of bringing an action
against me for trespass, &amp;c., and thereby effect my ruin. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
have received information that such is the case in the event
of my making one false step, and which I have every reason
to believe is true.’”</p>

<p>Crockford was examined, but the Committee got very
little out of that old fox, except the fact that he had given
up all active connection with the establishment in St James’s
Street for over four years.</p>

<p>Mr Mayne was recalled on the 9th May 1844, and gave
evidence that, two nights previously, an entry was made into
all houses, known to be gaming-houses in town, seventeen in
number, with the result of a fine haul of men, money, and
gaming implements.</p>

<p>The outcome of the Select Committees of both Houses of
Parliament was the passing, on 8th August 1845, of 8-9 Vic.,
c. 109, “An Act to amend the Law against Games and
Wagers”&mdash;and for many years afterwards professional
gaming-houses in London were a tradition of the past.
Now, however, they abound, thanks to the laxity of the law
with regard to so-called clubs.</p>

<p class="p2">Here, then, ends the account of this phase of gambling,
as it has been thought inexpedient to give any modern
instances of play at so-called Clubs, or Card-sharping.</p>

days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty
sheets and thirty changes of garments.</p>

<p>“13. But, if ye cannot declare it me, then shall you give
me thirty sheets and thirty changes of garments. And they
said unto him, put forth thy riddle that we may hear it.</p>

<p>“14. And he said unto them, out of the eater came forth
meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And
they could not, in three days, expound the riddle.</p>

<p>“15. And it came to pass, on the seventh day, that they
said unto Samson’s wife, Entice thy husband, that he may
declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father’s
house with fire: have ye called us to take that we have? is
it not so?</p>

<p>“16. And Samson’s wife wept before him, and said, Thou
dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a
riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told it
me. And he said unto her, I have not told it my father,
nor my mother, and shall I tell it thee?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>“17. And she wept before him the seven days, while the
feast lasted; and it came to pass, on the seventh day, that
he told her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told
the riddle to the children of her people.</p>

<p>“18. And the men of the city said unto him, on the
seventh day, before the sun went down, what is sweeter than
honey? and what is stronger than a lion? And he said
unto them, if ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not
found out my riddle.</p>

<p>“19. And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he
went down to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and
took their spoil, and gave changes of raiment unto them
which expounded the riddle. And his anger was kindled,
and he went up to his father’s house.</p>

<p>“20. But Samson’s wife was given to his companion,
whom he had used as his friend.”</p>

<p>Now, in this very ancient story, we find embodied as much
roguery and crime as in any modern turf episode. Samson
bet without any means of paying, if he lost: he lost, and
was a defaulter. But, to pay this “debt of honour,” he had
recourse to wholesale murder and robbery&mdash;to satisfy men,
who to his own knowledge, had (to use a modern expression)
“tampered with the stable.”</p>

<p>The early Greeks betted, as we find in Homer’s <i>Iliad</i>,
b. xxiii. 485-7 where Idomeneus offers a bet to the lesser
Ajax to back his own opinion:</p>

<p class="ppn6 p1">Δεῦρό νυν ή τρίποδος περιδώμεθον, ἠὲ λέβετος̓<br />
Ἳστορα δ̓  Ἀτρείδην Ἀγαμέμνονα θείομεν ὕμφω.<br />
Ὀππότεραι πρόθ̓  ἵπποἰ ἵνα γνοίης ὰποτίνων.</p>

<p class="ppn10 p1">“Now, come on!</p>
<p class="ppn4">A wager stake we, of tripod, or of caldron;<br />
And make we both Atreidès Agamemnon<br />
Judge, whether foremost are those mares: and so<br />
Learn shalt thou, to thy cost!”</p>

<p class="p1">In Homer’s <i>Odyssey</i>, xxiii. 78, Eurycleia wagers her life
to Penelope that Ulysses has returned: Aristophanes in his
<i>Equites</i>, 791; <i>Acharnes</i>, 772, 1115; and <i>Nebulæ</i>, 644, gives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
examples of wagers; and, in the eighth idyll of Theocritus,
Daphins proposes a bet to Menalcas about a singing match.</p>

<p>Among the Romans, Virgil tells us of a wager in his
third <i>Eclogue</i> of the <i>Bucolics</i>, 28-50, between Menalcas and
Damœtas, which is virtually the same as that of Theocritus,
and Valerius Maximus tells us how a triumph was awarded
by the senate to Lutatius, the Consul, who had defeated the
Carthaginian fleet. The prætor Valerius, having also been
present in the action, asserted that the victory was his, and
that a triumph was due to him also. The question came
before the judge; but not until Valerius had first, in support
of his assertion, deposited a stake, against which Lutatius
deposited another. But in classical time they seem to have
known little about odds.</p>

<p>The word wager is an English word&mdash;and was spelt in
Middle English, <i>Wageoure</i>, or <i>Wajour</i>, as in <i>The Babee’s
Book</i>.</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“No <i>waiour</i> non with hym thou lay,<br />
Ne at the dyce with hym to play.”</p>

<p class="p1">It was in early use, for we have the <i>Wager of Battel</i>,
which was a practical bet between two men as to the justice
of their cause. This ordeal was in force until 1819, when it
was done away with by 59 Geo. III., c. 46.</p>

<p>In Shakespeare’s time betting was common, and the practice
of giving and taking odds was well known, as we may
see in <i>Hamlet</i>, Act v. s. 2, where Osrick, speaking to Hamlet,
says, “The King, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary
horses; against which he hath imponed, as I take it, six
French Rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdles,
hangers and so.” In <i>Cymbeline</i>, Act i. s. 5, we have a bet,
which is so serious that it has to be recorded. Iachimo
says, “I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to
your ring, which, in my opinion, o’ervalues it something,”
and, ultimately, ten thousand crowns are laid against the
ring, and Iachimo says, “I will fetch my gold, and have
our two wagers recorded.”</p>

<p>By the way, there was an epitaph on Combe, the usurer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
which has been attributed to Shakespeare, which intimates
the laying of odds.</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“Ten in the hundred lies here ingraved;<br />
‘Tis a hundred to ten, his soul is not sav’d.”</p>

<p class="p1">It is recorded of Sir John Packington, called “Lusty
Packington” (Queen Elizabeth called him “her Temperance”),
that he entered into articles to swim against three
noblemen for £3000 from Westminster Bridge to Greenwich;
but the queen, by her special command, prevented
the bet being carried out.</p>

<p>Howell in his <i>Epistolæ Ho-Elianæ</i> says: “If one would try
a petty conclusion how much smoke there is in a pound of
Tobacco, the ashes will tell him: for, let a pound be exactly
weighed, and the ashes kept charily and weighed afterwards,
what wants of a pound weight in the ashes, cannot be denied
to have been smoke which evaporated into air. I have
been told that Sir Walter Rawleigh won a wager of Queen
Elizabeth upon this nicety.”</p>

<p>Men betted, but their wagers are not recorded until the
eighteenth century, and one of the earliest of these is told in
<i>Malcolm’s Anecdotes of the Manners and Customs of London
during the eighteenth century</i>. “Mrs Crackenthorpe, the
Female Tatler of 1709, tells us ‘that four worthy Senators
lately threw their hats into a river, laid a crown each whose
hat should first swim to the mill, and ran hallooing after
them; and he that won the prize, was in a greater rapture
than if he had carried the most dangerous point in
Parliament.’”</p>

<p>“There was an established Cock pit in Prescot Street,
Goodman’s Fields, 1712: there the Gentlemen of the East
entertained themselves, while the Nobles and others of the
West were entertained by the edifying exhibition of the
agility of their running footmen. His Grace of Grafton
declared <i>his</i> man was unrivalled in speed; and the Lord
Cholmondeley betted him that <i>his</i> excelled even the unrivalled;
accordingly, the ground was prepared for a two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
mile heat, in Hyde Park; the race was run, <i>and one of the
parties was victor</i>, but <i>which</i>, my informant does not say.”</p>

<p>“I have frequently observed, in the course of my researches,
the strange methods and customs peculiar to
gaming, horse racing, dice and wagers; the latter are generally
governed by whim and extreme folly. We have already
noticed Noblemen running their Coaches and Footmen. In
1729, a Poulterer of Leadenhall Market betted £50, he
would walk 202 times round the area of Upper Moorfields
in 27 hours, and, accordingly, proceeded at the rate of five
miles an hour on the <i>amusing pursuit</i>, to the infinite improvement
of his business, and great edification of hundreds
of spectators. Wagers are now a favourite custom with too
many of the Londoners; they very frequently, however,
originate over the bottle, or the porter pot.”</p>

<p>“To characterise the follies of the day, it will be necessary
to add to the account of the <i>walking</i> man, another, of a
<i>hopping man</i>, who engaged to hop 500 yards, in 50 hops, in
St James’s Park, which he performed in 46. This important
event occurred in December 1731.”</p>

<p>In No. 145 of the <i>Spectator</i> (16th Aug. 1711) is a letter
about the prevalence of laying wagers. “Among other
things which your own experience must suggest to you,
it will be very obliging if you please to take notice of
wagerers.</p>

<p class="ptb2 p1">·······</p>

<p class="p1">“Not long ago, I was relating that I had read such a
passage in Tacitus; up starts my young gentleman, in a
full company, and, pulling out his purse, offered to lay me
ten guineas, to be staked, immediately, in that gentleman’s
hands, pointing to one smoking at another table, that I was
utterly mistaken. I was dumb for want of ten guineas; he
went on unmercifully to triumph over my ignorance how to
take him up, and told the whole room he had read Tacitus
twenty times over, and such a remarkable incident as that,
could not escape him. He has, at this time, three considerable
wagers depending between him and some of his companions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
who are rich enough to hold an argument with him.
He has five guineas upon questions in geography, two that
the Isle of Wight is a peninsula, and three guineas to one,
that the world is round. We have a gentleman comes to
our coffee house, who deals mightily in antique scandal;
my disputant has laid him twenty pieces upon a point of
history.”</p>

<p>It was in the early part of the eighteenth century that
betting was made a part of professional gambling, as we
read in Smollett’s <i>Adventures of Ferdinand, Count Fathom</i>.
On his return to England “he perceived that gaming was
now managed in such a manner, as rendered skill and dexterity
of no advantage; for the spirit of play having overspread
the land, like a pestilence, raged to such a degree of
madness and desperation, that the unhappy people who were
infected, laid aside all thoughts of amusement, economy, or
caution, and risqued their fortunes upon issues equally extravagant,
childish and absurd.</p>

<p>“The whole mystery of the art was reduced to the simple
exercise of tossing up a guinea, and the lust of laying
wagers, which they indulged to a surprising pitch of ridiculous
intemperance. In one corner of the room might
be heard a pair of lordlings running their grandmothers
against each other, that is, betting sums on the longest liver;
in another, the success of the wager depended upon the sex
of the landlady’s next child: one of the waiters happening
to drop down in an apoplectic fit, a certain noble peer exclaimed,
‘Dead, for a thousand pounds.’ The challenge was
immediately accepted; and when the master of the house
sent for a surgeon to attempt the cure, the nobleman, who set
the price upon the patient’s head, insisted upon his being
left to the efforts of nature alone, otherwise the wager should
be void: nay, when the landlord harped upon the loss he
should sustain by the death of a trusty servant, his lordship
obviated the objection, by desiring that the fellow might be
charged in the bill.”</p>

<p>Horace Walpole in a letter to Sir H. Mann (1 Sep.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
1750) tells a similar tale. “They have put in the papers
a good story made on White’s; a man dropped down dead
at the door, was carried in; the club immediately made
bets whether he was dead or not, and when they were going
to bleed him, the wagerers for his death interposed, and
said it would affect the fairness of the bet.” But there is
no such bet mentioned in White’s betting book.</p>

<p>They even betted in the House of Commons. In the
course of a debate Mr Pulteney charged Sir Robert Walpole
with misquoting Horace; the prime minister replied by
offering to bet that he had not done so, and the wager was
accepted. The clerk of the House was called upon to
decide the question, and declared Pulteney right; upon
which Sir Robert threw a guinea across the House, to be
picked up by his opponent, with the remark that it was the
first public money he had touched for a long time.</p>

<p>Brookes’ betting book has C. J. Fox’s name frequently.
In 1744 he bet Lord Northington that he would be called
to the Bar within four years time. In 1755, he received
one guinea from Lord Bolingbroke, upon condition of paying
him a thousand pounds when the debts of the country
amounted to a hundred and seventy-one millions; an event
Fox lived to see come to pass.</p>

<p>In the <i>Connoisseur</i> of 9th May 1754 is an article on the
prevalence of wagers. It says: “Tho’ most of our follies are
imported from France, this had its rise and progress entirely
in England. In the last illness of Louis XIV. Lord Stair
laid a wager on his death; and we may guess what the
French thought of it, from the manner in which Voltaire
mentions it, in his <i>Siècle de Louis XIV</i>. ‘Le roi fut attaqué
vers le milieu du mois d’Août. Le Comte de Stair, ambassadeur
d’Angleterre <i>paria, selon le génie de sa nation</i>,
que le roi ne passeroit pas le mois de Septembre.’ ‘The
King,’ says he, ‘was taken ill about the middle of August;
when Lord Stair, the Ambassador from England, <i>betted
according to the custom of his nation</i>, that the king would
not live beyond September.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>I am in some pain lest this custom should get among
the ladies. They are, at present, very deep in cards and
dice; and while my lord is gaining abroad, her ladyship
has her rout at home. I am inclined to suspect that our
women of fashion will, also, learn to divert themselves with
this polite practice of laying wagers. A birthday suit, the
age of a beauty, who invented a particular fashion, or who
were supposed to be together at the last masquerade, would,
frequently give occasion for bets. This would, also, afford
them a new method for the ready propagation of scandal,
as the truth of several stories which are continually flitting
about the town, would, naturally, be brought to the same
test. Should they proceed further, to stake the lives of their
acquaintances against each other, they would, doubtless,
bet with the same fearless spirit, as they are known to do
at <i>brag</i>; one husband would, perhaps, be pitted against
another, or a woman of the town against a maid of
honour. In a word, if this once becomes fashionable among
the ladies, we shall soon see the time, when an allowance
for bet money will be stipulated in the marriage
articles.</p>

<p>As the vices and follies of persons of distinction are very
apt to spread, I am much afraid lest this branch of gaming
should descend to the common people. Indeed, it seems
already to have got among them. We have frequent
accounts of tradesmen riding, walking, eating and drinking
for a wager. The contested election in the City has occasioned
several extraordinary bets. I know a butcher in
Leadenhall Market, who laid an ox to a shin of beef on the
success of Sir John Barnard against the field; and have
been told of a publican in Thames Street, who ventured a
hogshead of entire beer on the candidate who serves him
with beer.”</p>

<p>Walpole tells one or two stories about betting in the
course of his chatty letters. “Dec. 19, 1750. There has
been a droll cause in Westminster Hall: a man laid another
a wager that he produced a person who should weigh as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
much again as the Duke.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> When they had betted, they
recollected not knowing how to desire the Duke to step
into a scale. They agreed to establish his weight at twenty
stone, which, however, is supposed to be two more than he
weighs. One Bright,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> was then produced, who is since
dead, and who, actually, weighed forty-two stone and a half.
As soon as he was dead, the person who had lost, objected
that he had been weighed in his clothes, and though it was
impossible that his clothes could weigh above two stone,
they went to law. There were the Duke’s twenty stone
bawled over a thousand times; but the righteous law
decided against the man who had won!”</p>

<p>“10th July 1774. One of them has committed a
murder, and intends to repeat it. He betted £1500 that
a man could live twelve hours under water; hired a desperate
fellow, sunk him in a ship, by way of experiment,
and both ship and man have not appeared since. Another
man and ship are to be tried for their lives, instead of Mr
Blake, the assassin.”</p>

<p>On 30 June 1765 a wager of 1000 guineas was decided
between two noblemen, one of whom had constructed a
machine which was to work a boat at the rate of 25 miles
an hour: a canal was prepared near the banks of the
Thames, on which to try it, but the tackle breaking, the bet
was lost.</p>

<p>28 Feb. 1770. A bet was laid by a noble earl that he
would procure a man to ride to Edinburgh from London,
and back, in less time than another noble earl could make a
million of scores, or distinct dots, in the most expeditious
manner that he could contrive.</p>

<p>On 12th June 1771 was tried before Lord Mansfield and
a special jury, in the Court of King’s Bench, a cause wherein
Lord March was plaintiff, and Mr Pigot, defendant. The
action was brought to recover the sum of 500 guineas for a
wager which Lord March had laid with Mr Pigot, whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Sir William Codrington or old Mr Pigot would die first. Mr
Pigot happened to die suddenly from gout in his head on
the morning previous to the laying of the wager, and the
younger Mr Pigot thought, from this circumstance, that it
was no bet. The defendant’s counsel said, that if you make
a bet for two horses to run, and one of them should die
before the race came off, there could be no bet; and he
hoped that the jury would find for his client. After a
short charge from the judge, the jury brought in a verdict
for the plaintiff of 500 guineas, and full costs of suit.</p>

<p>On 1st July 1777 a case came before the Lord Chief-Justice
Mansfield, which is one of the most extraordinary
that ever was tried in a Court of Justice, respecting the sex
of the Chevalier d’Eon, formerly ambassador to England
from the Court of France.</p>

<p>The action was brought by Mr Hayes, surgeon, against
one Jacques, a broker and underwriter, for the recovery of
£700, the said Jacques having, about six years previously,
received premiums of fifteen guineas per cent., for every
one of which he stood engaged to return <i>one hundred
guineas</i>, whenever it should be proved that the Chevalier
d’Eon was, actually, a woman.</p>

<p>Mr Buller opened the case as counsel for Mr Hayes.
He stated the fairness of the transaction, and the justifiable
nature of the demand, as Mr Hayes, the plaintiff, thought
himself now to be in possession of that proof which would
determine the sex of the Chevalier d’Eon, and, for ever,
render the case indisputable.</p>

<p>In proof of the fact, M. de Goux, a surgeon, was the first
witness called, and gave his testimony to the following effect:
That he had been acquainted with the Chevalier d’Eon from
the time when the Duc de Nivernois resided in England in
quality of ambassador from the Court of France. That to
his certain knowledge, the person called the Chevalier d’Eon
was a woman.</p>

<p>Being closely interrogated by the counsel for the defendant,
as to the mode of his acquiring such a degree of certainty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
relative to the sex of the party, M. de Goux gave this account
of the matter: That, about five years ago, he was called in
by the Chevalier d’Eon, to lend his professional aid, as she,
at that time, laboured under a disorder which rendered an
examination of the afflicted part absolutely necessary. That
this examination led, of course, to that discovery of the sex
of which M. de Goux was now enabled to give such
testimony.</p>

<p>The second witness called on the part of the plaintiff
was M. de Morande. He swore that, so long ago as
the 3rd of July 1774, the Chevalier d’Eon made a free
disclosure of her sex to the witness. That she had even
proceeded so far as to display her bosom on the occasion.
That, in consequence of this disclosure of sex, she, the
Chevalier d’Eon, had exhibited the contents of her female
wardrobe, which consisted of sacques, petticoats, and other
habiliments calculated for feminine use. That, on the said
3rd day of July 1774, the witness paid a morning visit to
the Chevalier d’Eon, and, finding her in bed, accosted her
in a style of gallantry respecting her sex. That, so far from
being offended with this freedom, the said Chevalier desired
the witness to approach nearer to her bed, and then permitted
him to have manual proof of her being, in very truth,
a woman.</p>

<p>Mr Mansfield, on the part of the defendant, pleaded that
this was one of those gambling, indecent and unnecessary
cases, that ought never to be permitted to come into a Court
of Justice; that, besides the inutility and indecency of the
case, the plaintiff had taken advantage of his client, being in
possession of intelligence that enabled him to lay with
greater certainty, although with such great odds on his
side; that the plaintiff, at the time of laying the wager,
knew that the Court of France treated with the Chevalier,
as a woman, to grant her a pension; and that the French
Court must have had some strong circumstances to imbibe
that idea; therefore, he hoped the jury would reprobate
such wagers. The defendant’s counsel did not attempt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
contradict the plaintiff’s’ evidence, by proving the masculine
gender.</p>

<p>Lord Mansfield expressed his abhorrence of the whole
transaction, and the more so, for their bringing it into a
Court of Justice, when it might have been settled elsewhere;
wishing it had been in his power, in concurrence
with the jury, to have made both parties lose; but, as the
law had not expressly prohibited it, and the wager was
laid, the question before them was, who had won? His
Lordship remarked that the indecency of the proceeding
arose more from the unnecessary questions asked, than from
the case itself; that the witnesses had declared they perfectly
knew the Chevalier d’Eon to be a woman; if she is
not a woman, they are certainly perjured: there was, therefore,
no need of inquiring how, or by what methods they
knew it, which was all the indecency.</p>

<p>As to the fraud suggested, of the plaintiff’s knowing
more than the defendant, he seemed to think there was no
foundation for it. His Lordship then recited a wager
entered into by two gentlemen, in his own presence, about
the dimensions of the Venus de Medicis, for £100. One of
the gentlemen said, “I will not deceive you; I tell you
fairly, I have been there, and measured it myself.” “Well,”
says the other, “and do you think I should be such a fool,
as to lay if I had not measured it?... I will lay for
all that.”</p>

<p>His Lordship then went on to state to the jury, that this
Chevalier had publicly appeared as a man, had been employed
by the Court of France, as a man, as a military man, in a
civil office, and as a Minister of State here, and in Russia;
there was all the presumption against the plaintiff, and the
<i>onus probandi</i> lay upon him, which might never been come
at; for it appeared, the only proposition of a discovery of
sex that had been made to the Chevalier, by some gentlemen
on an excursion, had been resented by d’Eon, who had
instantly quitted their company on that account: it might,
therefore, never have been in his power to have proved his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
wager, but for some accidental quarrels between d’Eon and
some of her countrymen. His Lordship was, therefore, of
opinion that the jury should find a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>

<p>The jury, without hesitation, gave a verdict for the
plaintiff, £700, and 40s. Yet, when d’Eon died, in London,
in 1810, <i>it was proved, without a shadow of a doubt, that he
was a man</i>.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="beg">A different</span> kind of wager is recorded in <i>The World</i>, of
4th May 1787. “At the Wheel, at Hackington Fen, on
Wednesday sen’night, a fen farmer laid a wager he could
eat <i>two dozen</i> of penny mutton pies, and drink a gallon of
ale in half an hour, which he performed <i>with ease</i>, in half

appetite gormandized with great composure. He thanked

out on Monday the 22nd instant, to walk to Constantinople
and back again in one year. It is said that the young
gentleman has £20,000 depending on the performance of
this exploit. 1st June 1789, Mr Whaley arrived about this
time in Dublin from his journey to the Holy Land, considerably
within the limited time of twelve months. The
above wager, however whimsical, is not without a precedent.
Some years ago, a baronet of some fortune, in the north,
laid a considerable wager that he would go to Lapland,
bring home two females of that country and two reindeer in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
a given time. He performed his journey, and effected his
purpose in every respect. The Lapland women lived with
him for about a year, but, having a wish to go back to their
own country, the baronet very generously furnished them
with means and money.”</p>

<p>In Trinity Term, 1790, was argued in the Court of
King’s Bench, whether all wagers, by the 14th George III.,
were not void, as gaming contracts, and being contrary to
the policy of the law? Lord Kenyon and Justices Ashurst
and Grose were of opinion, that the law had not declared
all wagers illegal, however desirable such a law might be.
Wagers that led to a breach of the peace, to immorality, the
injury of a third person, or that had a libellous tendency,
were void; but some wagers, between indifferent people,
were, certainly legal, both by the common law, and by
statute. Mr Justice Buller differed from the rest of the
Court.</p>

<p><i>Times</i>, October 2, 1795. “A curious circumstance occurred
here (Brighton) yesterday. Sir <span class="smcap">John Lade</span>, for a
trifling wager, undertook to carry Lord <span class="smcap">Cholmondeley</span>, on
<i>his back</i>, from opposite the Pavilion, twice round the Steine.
Several ladies attended to be spectators of this extraordinary
feat of the dwarf carrying the giant. When his Lordship
declared himself ready, Sir John desired him to <i>strip</i>.
‘Strip!’ exclaimed the other, ‘why, surely, you promised
to carry me in my clothes!’ ‘By no means,’ replied the
Baronet, I engaged to carry <i>you</i>, but not an inch of clothes.
So, therefore, my Lord, make ready, and let us not <i>disappoint</i>
the ladies.’ After much laughable altercation, it
was, at length, decided that Sir <span class="smcap">John</span> had won his wager,
the Peer declining to exhibit <i>in puris naturalibus</i>.”</p>

<p><i>Times</i>, September 11, 1797. “A <i>Mr Marston</i>, of the
Borough, has laid a bet of 2000 guineas, that he will, in
the course of the ensuing week, go into one of the great
wheels of the water works at London Bridge, while it is
in its swiftest motion with an ebb tide, stay there five
minutes, and come out again with safety, though not without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
accident, in a different part from that in which he went
in: and, afterwards, walk one mile within an hour, on
condition that the lower bucket of the wheel is two feet
from the river bottom.”</p>

<p>A wager was made, in 1806, in the Castle Yard, York,
between Thomas Hodgson and Samuel Whitehead, as
to which should succeed in assuming the most singular
character. Umpires were selected, whose duty it was to
decide upon the comparative absurdity of the costumes in
which the two men appeared. On the appointed day,
Hodgson came before the umpires, decorated with bank
notes of various value on his coat and waistcoat, a row of
five guinea notes, and a long netted purse of gold round his
hat, whilst a piece of paper, bearing the words “John Bull,”
was attached to his back. Whitehead was dressed like a
woman on one side; one half of his face was painted, and
he wore a silk stocking and a slipper on one leg. The
other half of his face was blacked, to resemble a negro: on
the corresponding side of his body he wore a gaudy, long-tailed,
linen coat; and his leg was cased in half a pair of
leather breeches, with a boot and spur. One would fancy
that Whitehead must have presented the most singular
appearance, by far, but the umpires thought differently,
and awarded the stakes to Hodgson.</p>

<p>In the early part of this century sporting men were
fond of betting on the duration of the lives of celebrities.
Napoleon I. was specially the subject of these wagers.
It is related that, at a dinner party in 1809, Sir Mark
Sykes offered to pay any one who would give him a
hundred guineas down, a guinea a day, so long as Napoleon
lived. The offer was taken by a clergyman present; and,
for three years, Sir Mark Skyes paid him three hundred and
sixty-five guineas per annum. He, then, thought he had
thrown away enough money, and disputed further payment.
The recipient, who was not at all disposed to lose his
comfortable annuity, brought an action, which, after lengthy
litigation, was decided in favour of the baronet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>A gentleman made a bet of 1000 guineas that he would
have a coat made in the course of a single day, from the
first process of shearing the sheep to its completion by the
tailor. The wager was decided at Newbury on the 25th of
June 1811, by Mr John Coxeter of Greenham Mills, near
that town. At five o’clock that morning, Sir John Throckmorton,
Bart., presented two Southdown wether sheep to
Mr Coxeter. Accordingly, the sheep were shorn, the wool
spun, the yarn spooled, warped, loomed and wove, the cloth
burred, milled, rowed, dyed, dried, sheared and pressed, and
put into the hands of the tailors by four o’clock that afternoon;
and, at twenty minutes past six, the coat entirely
finished, was presented by Mr Coxeter to Sir John Throckmorton,
who appeared, wearing it, before an assemblage of
upwards of 5000 spectators, who rent the air with their
acclamations.</p>

<p>The religious impostor, Johanna Southcott, was the subject
of at least one wager, for, concerning that, an action was
brought on a bet that she would be delivered of a son, on or
before 1st Nov. 1814. As she was a single woman it was
held that no action could be sustained, as the wager involved
the perpetration of an immorality.</p>

<p>I cannot give chapter and verse for the next two anecdotes,
but they are generally accepted as true. The first is
about Lord Brougham, who, in his college days, went one
autumn to Dumfries in order to make one at the Caledonian
Hunt meeting. According to the then custom, everybody
dined at a <i>table d’hôte</i>, and, after dinner, betting set in.
Brougham offered to bet the whole company that none of
them would write down the manner in which he meant to
go to the races next day. Those who accepted his challenge
wrote down their conjectures and Brougham wrote down
his intention of travelling in a sedan chair, a mode of conveyance
no one had hit upon. To the races he went, an
immense crowd seeing him safely chaired to the course.
The bet was then renewed, as to the manner of his return
to Dumfries, the acceptors taxing their wits to imagine the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
most improbable methods of travelling. Brougham had
calculated upon this, and won the double event by returning
in a post chaise and pair.</p>

<p>The other is a story of Brunel and Stephenson. They were
travelling together in a railway carriage, Stephenson being
wrapped in a dark plaid, on the exact disposition of the folds of
which he rather plumed himself. “You are looking at my
plaid,” said he to Brunel; “I’ll bet you ten pounds you cannot
put it on, properly, the first time.” “I’ll bet ten pounds
against the plaid,” said Brunel. “If I put it on right when
we get out at the next station the plaid is mine; if I miss
I pay you ten pounds.” “Done,” said Stephenson. Brunel
sat silent until the train stopped; then, stepping on the platform,
he asked for the plaid, which was slowly unwound by its
owner and handed over: not to be handed back again, for
Brunel wound it round his own shoulders as if he had always
worn it. He had never tried it before, but, when challenged,
did not like to be beaten, and, at once, set to work to study
the folds of the plaid. “I got the thing pretty clear in my
head before we reached the station, and when I saw him get
out of it I knew I was right, so I put it on at once.”</p>

<p>Wagers about walking and running are very numerous,
still a few might be mentioned, beginning with Foster
Powell, who, on 29th Nov. 1773, commenced a journey
from London to York and back in six days. He walked
from London to Stamford, 88 miles, on the first day; to
Doncaster, 72 miles, on the second; to York, 37 miles, and
22 miles back to Ferrybridge on the third; to Grantham,
65 miles, on the fourth; to Eaton, 54 miles, on the fifth;
and the final spin of 56 miles on the sixth&mdash;making a total
of 394 miles between Monday morning and Saturday night,
and winning a wager of one hundred guineas.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards a reputed centenarian, and, admittedly, a
<i>very</i> aged man, undertook to walk 10 miles on the Hammersmith
Road in 2 hours and 30 minutes, for a wager of ten
guineas, and he accomplished his task in 2 hours 23 minutes.</p>

<p>Captain Barclay, a famous pedestrian, in the early part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the present century, began his exploits at the early age of
fifteen by walking six miles in an hour, fair toe and heel.
His next feat was to walk from Ury, in Kincardineshire, to
Boroughbridge, in Yorkshire, about 300 miles, in five very
hot days. He hazarded the large sum of 5000 guineas,
that he would walk 90 miles in 20 hours 30 minutes, and
he accomplished this arduous task in 19 hours 22 minutes.
But his greatest pedestrian feat was performed in July 1809,
and is thus described in the <i>Annual Register</i>:</p>

<p>“July 13. <i>Captain Barclay.</i> This gentleman, on Wednesday,
completed his arduous pedestrian undertaking to
walk a thousand miles in a thousand successive hours, at the
rate of a mile in each and every hour. He had until four
o’clock <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> to finish his task, but he performed his last mile
in the quarter of an hour after three, with perfect ease and
great spirit, amidst an immense concourse of spectators.
For the last two days he appeared in higher spirits, and
performed his mile with more ease, and in shorter time,
than he had done for some days past. With the change of
the weather he had thrown off his loose greatcoat, which he
wore during the rainy period, and, on Wednesday, performed
in a flannel jacket. He also put on shoes remarkably
thicker than any which he had used in any previous part of
his performance. When asked how he meant to act after
he had finished his feat, he said he should, that night, take
a good sound sleep, but that he must have himself awaked
twice, or thrice, in the night to avoid the danger of a too
sudden transition from almost constant exertion, to a state
of long repose.</p>

<p>“One hundred to one, and, indeed, any odds, were offered
on Wednesday morning; but so strong was the confidence
in his success that no bets could be obtained. The multitude
of people who resorted to the scene of action, in the
course of the concluding days, was unprecedented. Not a
bed could be procured, on Tuesday night, at Newmarket,
Cambridge, or any of the towns and villages in the vicinity,
and every horse, and every species of vehicle was engaged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>“Captain Barclay had £16,000 depending upon his undertaking.
The aggregate of the bets is supposed to amount
to £100,000.”</p>

<p>In those days there were sportsmen like Osbaldeston and
Ross, who were ready for any wager. Let the latter tell a
little story.</p>

<p>“A large party were assembled at Black Hall, in Kincardineshire,
time, the end of July, or beginning of August.
We had all been shooting snipe and flapper-ducks, in a large
morass on the estate called Lumphannon. We had been
wading amongst bulrushes, up to our middles, for seven or
eight hours, and had had a capital dinner. After the ladies
had gone to the drawing room, I fell asleep; and, about
nine o’clock, was awakened by the late Sir Andrew Keith
Hay, who said, ‘Ross, old fellow! I want you to jump up,
and go as my umpire with Lord Kennedy, to Inverness. I
have made a bet of twenty-five hundred pounds a side, that
I get there, on foot, before him!’ Nothing came amiss to
the men of that day. My answer was, ‘All right, I’m
ready’; and off we started, there and then, in morning
costume, with thin shoes and silk stockings on our feet. We
went straight across the mountains, and it was a longish walk.
I called to my servant to follow with my walking shoes and
worsted stockings, and Lord Kennedy did the same. They
overtook us after we had gone seven or eight miles. Fancy
my disgust! My idiot bought me, certainly, worsted
stockings, but, instead of shoes, a pair of tight Wellington
boots! The sole of one boot vanished twenty-five miles
from Inverness, and I had, now, to finish the walk barefooted.
We walked all night, next day, and the next night&mdash;raining
in torrents all the way. We crossed the Grampians,
making a perfectly straight line, and got to Inverness at one
<span class="smcap">P.M.</span> We never saw, or heard, anything of Sir A. L. Hay,
(he went by the coach road, viâ Huntly and Elgin, thirty-six
miles further than we, but a good road) who appeared at ten
<span class="smcap">A.M.</span> much cast down at finding he had been beaten.”</p>

<p>There have been divers wagers about coaching, and also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
about horses, which have nothing to do with horse racing,
and a few may be chronicled here.</p>

<p>On 29th August 1750, at seven in the morning, was
decided, at Newmarket, a remarkable wager for 1000
guineas, laid by Count Taaf against the Earl of March and
Lord Eglinton, who were to provide a four wheeled carriage,
with a man in it, to be drawn by four horses at a speed of
19 miles an hour; which was performed in 53 min. 27 sec.
It was rather an imposing affair. A groom, dressed in
crimson velvet, rode before to clear the way: the boy who
sat in the vehicle was dressed in a white satin jacket, black
velvet cap, and red silk stockings, whilst the four postillions
were clothed in blue satin waistcoats, buckskin breeches, with
white silk stockings, and black velvet caps. The carriage is
thus described: “The pole was small, but lapp’d with fine
wire; the perch had a plate underneath, two cords went on
each side, from the back carriage to the fore carriage,
fastened to springs. The harness was of thin leather,
covered with silk; the seat for the man to sit on, was of
leather straps, and covered with velvet; the boxes of the
wheels were brass, and had tins of oil to drop slowly for an
hour: the breechings for the horses were of whale bone; the
bars were small wood, strengthened with steel springs, as were
most parts of the carriage; but all so light that a man could
carry the whole, with the harness; being but 2 cwt. and a
half.” Two or three other carriages had been made previously,
but had been disapproved of, and several horses had
been killed in trials&mdash;costing between £600 and £700.</p>

<p>In April and finishing on 3rd May 1758, at Newmarket,
Miss Pond, daughter of Mr Pond, the compiler and publisher
of the <i>Racing Calendar</i>, bearing his name, laid a wager of
200 guineas that she could ride 1000 miles in a 1000 hours,
and finished her match in a little more than two-thirds of
the time. At the conclusion, the country people strewed
flowers in her path. It has been said that this feat was performed
on <i>one horse</i>.</p>

<p>In the beginning of June 1800, a naval officer undertook,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
for a wager, to ride a blind horse round Sheerness racecourse
without guiding the reins with his hands; this he
performed to the no small amusement of the spectators, by
cutting the reins asunder, and fastening the several parts to
his feet in his stirrups.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best known match of modern times was one
made at the Ascot meeting of 1888, of £1000 to £500 that
a coach could not be driven to Brighton and back in eight
hours. James Selby, a professional whip, started from the
White Horse Cellar, Piccadilly, punctually at 10 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> on
July 13, and arrived at Brighton, at the Old Ship, at 1.56
<span class="smcap">P.M.</span> The coach was turned round and the return journey
instantly started; White Horse Cellar being reached at
5.50 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>: thus winning the match by ten minutes. Selby
died at the end of the year.</p>

<p>The betting book of White’s Club, dates from the year
1743&mdash;the older book and all the other records of the Club
having been destroyed in the fire of 1743. The following
are some of the wagers therein recorded. The early ones
are principally pitting lives against one another.</p>

<p><i>Feb. y<sup>e</sup> 3, 1743/4.</i> Lord Montford betts Mr Wardour
twenty Guineas on each, that Mr Shephard outlives Sir Hans
Sloan, the Dutchess Dowager of Marlborough, and Duke of
Somerset.&mdash;Voide.</p>

<p>Mr J<sup>no</sup> Jeffreys betts Mr Stephen Jansen Fifty Guineas,
that thirteen Members of Parliament don’t Die from the first
of Jan<sup>y</sup> 1744/5 to the first of Jan<sup>y</sup> 1745/6 exclusive of
what may be killed in battle.</p>

<p>Ld Leicester betts Lord Montfort One Hundred Guineas
that Six or more Peers of the British Parliament, including
Catholics, Minors, Bishops, and Sixteen Scotch Lords, shall
Die between the 2 of Decem<sup>r</sup> 1744, and the First of
Decem<sup>r</sup> 1745 inclusive.</p>

<p><i>16 July 1746.</i> Mr Heath wagers Mr Fanshawe five
guineas that the eldest son of the Pretender is dead, on, or
before this day. To be returned if the Pretender was dead.&mdash;pd.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>Nov<sup>r</sup> 28.</p>

<p><i>Oct<sup>r</sup> 20th 1746.</i> Mr Heath gave Col. Perry Twenty
Pounds, for which Col. Perry is to pay Mr Heath one
hundred pounds if ever he loses more than one hundred
pounds in any four and twenty hours.</p>

<p><i>Nov<sup>r</sup> y<sup>e</sup> 14, 1746.</i> Mr Fox betts Mr John Jeffreys five
guineas on Number Two against Number One in the present
Lottery.</p>

<p>Lord Montfort wagers S<sup>r</sup> Wm. Stanhope 20 guineas
that Lady Mary Coke has a child beford Ly Kildare, and
20 guineas more that L<sup>y</sup> Mary Coke has a child before
L<sup>y</sup> Fawkener.</p>

<p><i>January the 14th, 1747/8.</i> Mr Fanshawe wagers Lord
Dalkeith one guinea, that his peruke is better than his Lordship’s,
to be judged of by the majority of members the next
time they both shall meet.</p>

<p>These are fair specimens, and, after this date, the bets
begin to be political and personal, and devoid of interest.</p>

<p class="pch">Horse Racing&mdash;Early mention&mdash;Thirteenth Century&mdash;Racing for bells&mdash;Racing in

II.&mdash;James II.&mdash;Anne&mdash;Her fondness for racing&mdash;Sporting in her reign&mdash;Epsom&mdash;Tregonwell
Frampton&mdash;The three Georges&mdash;A duel&mdash;Turf anecdotes
of the Eighteenth Century.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="beg">But</span> this style of betting is harmless compared to that curse
of the England of our time, betting upon horse racing, which
can be compared to nothing but a social cancer, eating into
the very vitals of the nation; and it is especially a pity that
so noble an animal as the horse should be made the unconscious
medium of such a degrading passion as gambling&mdash;still,
the fact exists, and horse racing from its commencement
must be treated in a history of gambling in England.</p>

<p>Horses must have been introduced into this country at a
very early age, for, when Cæsar invaded Britain, he was
opposed by vast numbers of horsemen, and many centuries
had not elapsed before there was competition, as to speed,
among the animals. William of Malmesbury tells us that
running horses were sent from France by Stugh, the founder
of the house of Capet, as a present to King Athelstan. We
never hear of any races being run, and Fitzstephen, who was
secretary to Sir Thomas à Becket, and lived in the reign of
Henry II., scarcely describes what we should term a horse
race. Speaking of a certain Smoothfield, outside London
(Smithfield), he says:</p>

<p>“There, every Friday, unless it be one of the more solemn
festivals, is a noted show of well bred horses for sale. The
earls, barons and knights, who are, at the time resident in
the City, as well as most of the Citizens, flock thither, either
to look on, or buy. It is pleasant to see the nags, with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
sleek and shining coats, smoothly ambling along, raising and
setting down, alternatively, as it were, their feet on either
side: in one part are horses better adapted to esquires;
these, whose pace is rougher, but yet expeditious, lift up and
set down, as it were, the two opposite fore and hind feet
together: in another, the young blood colts not yet accustomed
to the bridle. In a third, are the horses for burden,
strong and stout limbed; and, in a fourth, the more valuable
chargers, of an elegant shape and noble height, with nimbly
moving ears, erect necks, and plump haunches. In the
movement of these, the purchasers observe, first, their easy
pace, and, then, their gallop, which is when their fore feet
are raised from the ground, and set down together, and the
hind ones in like manner alternately. When a race is to be
run by such horses as these, and, perhaps, by others, which,
in like manner, according to their breed, are strong for
carriage and vigorous for the course, the people raise a
shout, and order the common horses to be withdrawn to
another part of the field. The jockeys, who are boys expert
in the management of horses, which they regulate by means
of curb bridles, sometimes by threes, and sometimes by twos,
according as the match is made, prepare themselves for the
Contest. Their chief aim is to prevent a competitor getting
before them. The horses, too, after their manner, are eager
for the race; their limbs tremble, and, impatient of delay,
they cannot stand still; upon the signal being given, they
stretch out their limbs, hurry over the course, and are borne
along with unremitting speed. The riders, inspired with the
love of praise, and the hope of victory, clap spurs to their
flying horses, lashing them with their whips, and inciting
them with their shouts.”</p>

<p>In a metrical romance of the thirteenth century, “Syr
Beuys of Hampton,” printed by W. Copland in 1550, there
is mention of a race</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“In somer in whitsontyde<br />
whan knights most on horsbacke ride<br />
a cours let they make on a daye<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>Stedes and palfraye for to assaye<br />
whiche horse that best may ren<br />
thre myles the cours was then<br />
who that might ryd should<br />
have £ LI. of redy golde.”</p>

<p class="p1">Edward III. bought some running horses at £13, 6s. 8d.
each; and in the ninth year of his reign the King of Navarre
made him a present of two running horses. Still, very little
is heard of race horses until the time of Elizabeth and James
I. Bishop Hall, of Exeter and Norwich, in one of his Satires,
writes:</p>

<p class="ppn10 p1">“Dost thou prize</p>
<p class="ppn4">Thy brute beasts’ worth by their dam’s qualities?<br />
Say’st thou, this colt shall prove a swift-paced steed,<br />
Only because a jennet did him breed?<br />
Or say’st thou, this same horse shall win the prize,<br />
Because his dam was swiftest Trunchifice,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a><br />
Or Runcevall his syre; himself a galloway?<br />
While, like a tireling jade, he lags half way.”</p>

<p class="p1">In 1599, private matches by gentlemen, who were their
own riders, were very common, and, in the reign of James I.,
public races were established at various places, where the
discipline and mode of preparing the horses for running, etc.,
were much the same as they are now. The most celebrated
races of that time were called the “Bell Courses,” the prize
of the winner being a bell&mdash;hence the saying of “to bear the
bell”; and a tradition of it still remains in the couplet with
which children’s races are started.</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“Bell horses! Bell horses! what time of day?<br />
One o’clock, two o’clock, three, and away!”</p>

<p class="p1">Perhaps the oldest record that we have of these silver
bells is those of Paisley, which date from 1620, or 1608, as
on that date there is an entry in the town books showing
the purchase of a silver bell. The silver bells are now run
for, but there are 100 guineas attached to them. Silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
bells were also run for in this reign, at Gatherly, in Yorkshire,
Croydon, Chester, and Theobalds, the King’s hunting
lodge. Mr J. C. Whyte, in his <i>History of the British Turf</i>,
says that in Harl. MS. 2150, fol. 235, is an account of a
ceremony performed with the race for a bell at Chester, in
the presence of the Mayor, at the Cross, in the Rodhi, or
Roody, an open place near the City. I have examined the
MS. but cannot find the passage, so extract from his work
the following:</p>

<p>“A silver bell, valued at about three shillings and sixpence,
placed on the point of a lance, shall be given to
him, who shall run the best and furthest on horseback before
them on Shrove Tuesday. These bells went by the name
of St George’s bells, and the younger Randel Holme tells us
that, in the last year of this reign (1624) John Brereton,
innkeeper, Mayor of Chester, first caused the horses entered
for this race, then called St George’s Race, to start from the
point beyond the new Tower, and appointed them to run
five times round the Roody; and, he continues, he, who won
the last course, or trayne, received the bell, of a good value,
£8 or £10, and to have it for ever, which moneyes were
collected of the citizens for that purpose. By the use of the
term, for ever, it would appear that the bell had been used,
formerly, as a mark of temporary distinction only, by the
successful horsemen, and, afterwards, returned to the Corporation.”</p>

<p>On fol. 354 of this MS. we find “What y<sup>e</sup> companys
gave toward S. George’s Rase for the contynuance of a bell
or cup.” To this there is no date, but it amounted to
£36, 8s. 4d. The 3s. 6d. silver bell was substituted for a
wooden ball, which used to be raced for, as a prize, in the
31st year of King Henry VIII.</p>

<p>We see how simple, and for what small prizes they ran in
the early days of horse racing in England&mdash;it is sad to record
that betting, almost immediately, attended the popularity of
the sport. This we see in Shirley’s play of <i>Hide Parke</i>,
acted at Drury Lane in 1637.</p>

<p class="p1">Newmarket, hitherto, a royal hunting place, was made
into a race course in 1640, and we get a peep of what it
was like in an old ballad (said to be of about this time)
called “Newmarket,” published by D’Urfey, in his <i>Pills to

<p class="p1">Oliver Cromwell kept “running horses,” but there is no
mention of his having used them in racing: It is more
probable that he bred from them. With the Restoration,
horse racing was revived, and was much encouraged by
Charles II. who appointed races for his own amusement
at Datchet Mead, when he resided at Windsor. Newmarket,
however, became the principal locality for this sport, and the
round course was made in 1666. The King attended the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
races in person, established a house for his own accommodation,
and kept and entered horses in his own name. Instead
of bells, he gave a silver bowl or cup, value 100 guineas, on
which prize the exploits and pedigree of the successful horse
were generally engraved.</p>

<p>The times of James II. were too troubled for him to
amuse himself with horse racing, and William III. had no
leisure for the sport, although he added to the plates, and
founded an academy for riding, but, under Anne, the turf
was again under royal patronage.</p>

<p>The Queen was fond of racing, and gave £100 gold cups
to be raced for; nay, more, she not only kept race horses,
but ran them in her own name. Her six year old grey
gelding Pepper, ran for her gold cup, at York (over Clifton
and Rawcliffe Ing’s), on July 28, 1712. Over the same
course, and for the same stake, on Aug. 3, 1714, ran her
grey horse Mustard, which in 1714 was entered to run in
Whitsun Week, at Guildford, in Surrey, for the £50 plate;
and, sad to tell, her brown horse Star, ran at York, for a
plate value £14, and won it, on July 30, 1714, the very
day on which the Queen was struck with apoplexy, expiring
the next day.</p>

<p>She paid a visit to Newmarket, in April 1705, going to
Cambridge once or twice during her stay. Narcissus Luttrell
tells us: “Aprill 26, 1705. The queen has ordered
her house at Newmarket to be rebuilt, and gave a thousand
pounds towards paving the town; and bought a running
horse of Mr Holloway, which cost a 1000 guineas, and
gave it to the Prince.” Prince George of Denmark shared
his royal consort’s love of horse racing, and gave, at least,
two gold plates to be raced for, worth 100 guineas each.
This seems to have been a very horsey year for the Queen,
for Luttrell tells us that “the queen has appointed horse
races to be at Datchet, after her return from Winchester to
Windsor.”</p>

<p>A few racing mems of this time will illustrate to what an
extent the passion for the turf was carried. 1702: “They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
write from Newmarket, That the Lord Godolphin’s and
Mr Harvy’s Horses ran for £3000. His Lordship won:
As, also, the Earl of Argile, and the Duke of Devonshire’s;
the latter’s Horse won, by which Mr Pheasant got
a considerable sum.” 1703: “The great horse race at
Newmarket, run for 1000 guineas between the Lord Treasurer
and the Duke of Argyle, was won by the latter.”
Perhaps the earliest Sporting Paper is “News from <i>Newmarket</i>,
or, An Account of the Horses Match’d to Run
there in <i>March</i>, <i>April</i>, and May, 1704. The Weight,
Miles, Wagers and Forfeits. Printed for <i>John Nutt</i> near
Stationer’s Hall, price 2d.” 1707: “Last Monday was
a horse race at Newmarket, between Lord Granby’s Grantham,
and Mr Young’s Blundel, for £3000&mdash;the latter
won.” On April 10, 1708, at Newmarket, the Duke of
Bedford’s bay horse (9 stone) had a match with Mr Minchall’s
bay colt (8-1/2 stone) for 1000 guineas, but there is no
record of which won. These were the highest stakes mentioned
during the reign: they were, generally, for 200 or
300 guineas.</p>

<p>The first mention I can find of Epsom Races, is in this
reign, and is in the <i>London Gazette</i>, April and May 26/3,
1703, when three small plates were to be run for, of £30,
£10 and £5 value. On May 25, 1704, there was only
one to be competed for, and that for £20. They had very
early “Epsom Spring Meetings”; for, in the <i>Daily Courant</i>,
Feb. 15, 1709, it says: “On Epsom Downes, in Surrey, on
the first Monday after the Frost, a plate of £20 will be run
for,” &amp;c. Races on these downs have been held continuously
since 1730.</p>

<p>The most famous sporting man of his time was Tregonwell
Frampton, Esq. of Moreton, Dorsetshire, “The
Father of the Turf,” who was keeper of her Majesty’s
running horses at Newmarket&mdash;a post which he had filled
in the time of William III., and which he continued to hold
under Georges I. and II. He is described as being “the
oldest, and as they say, the cunningest jockey in England:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
one day he lost 1000 guineas, the next he won 2000, and
so, alternately. He made as light of throwing away £500 or
£1000, at a time, as other men do of their pocket money,
and was perfectly calm, cheerful and unconcerned when he
lost a thousand pounds, as when he won it.”</p>

<p>George I. is said to have been at Newmarket in 1716,
1717, and 1718, but neither he nor his successor cared for
horse racing, although they still kept “running horses.”
George III. used to attend Ascot Races, and his uncle the
“butcher,” Duke of Cumberland, was a great patron of the
turf, and was the breeder of the celebrated horse Eclipse.
As Walpole says of him, 29th Dec. 1763: “The beginning
of October, one is certain that everybody will be at Newmarket,
and the Duke of Cumberland will lose, and Shafto<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
win, two or three thousand pounds.” It was about this
time that the betting ring started, and roguery was not
uncommon, as we may see by the following:</p>

<p>At the Kingston Lent Assizes, 1767, a case was tried
between an unnamed gentleman, as plaintiff, and Mr Wm.
Courtney, defendant; the action was upon a wager of 100
guineas, which was reduced to writing, that plaintiff procured
three horses that should go ninety miles in three hours,
which defendant laid he did not. The plaintiff proved his
case very well; but, it appearing to the court and jury that
it was an unfair bet, the jury gave a verdict for the
defendant. It seems that the way in which the plaintiff performed
his undertaking, was by starting all the three horses
together, so that they had but thirty miles apiece to run in
the three hours, which, of course, was easily done.</p>

<p>In chronological order comes a story of a duel in which
the notorious black leg, Dick England, was concerned.</p>

<p>“Mr Richard England was put to the Bar, at the Old
Bailey (1796) charged with the ‘wilful murder’ of Mr
Rowlls, brewer, of Kingston, in a duel at Crauford Bridge,
June 18, 1784.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>“Lord Derby, the first witness, gave evidence that he was
present at Ascot races. When in the stand upon the race
course, he heard Mr England cautioning the gentlemen
present not to bet with the deceased, as he neither paid
what he lost, nor what he borrowed. On which Mr Rowlls
went up to him, called him rascal, or scoundrel, and offered
to strike him; when Mr England bid him stand off, or he
would be obliged to knock him down; saying, at the
same time&mdash;‘We have interrupted the company sufficiently
here, and, if you have anything further to say to me,
you know where I am to be found.’ A further altercation
ensued; but his Lordship, being at the other end
of the stand, did not distinctly hear it, and, then, the parties
retired.</p>

<p>“Lord Dartrey, afterwards Lord Cremorne, and his lady,
with a gentleman, were at the inn at the time when the duel
was fought. They went into the garden, and endeavoured
to prevent the duel; Mr Rowlls desired his Lordship and
others not to interfere; and, on a second attempt of his
Lordship to make peace, Mr Rowlls said, if they did not
retire, he must, though reluctantly, call them impertinent.
Mr England, at the same time, stepped forward, and took off
his hat; he said&mdash;‘Gentlemen, I have been cruelly treated;
I have been injured in my honour and character; let reparation
be made, and I am ready to have done this moment.’
Lady Dartrey retired. His Lordship stood in the bower of
the garden until he saw Mr Rowlls fall. One, or two, witnesses
were called, who proved nothing material. A paper,
containing the prisoner’s defence, being read, <i>the Earl of
Derby</i>, <i>the Marquis of Hertford</i>, <i>Mr Whitbread, jun.</i>, <i>Col.
Bishopp, and other gentlemen</i>, were called to his character.
They all spoke of him as a man of <i>decent, gentlemanly
deportment</i>, who, instead of seeking quarrels, was studious
to avoid them. He had been friendly to Englishmen while
abroad, and had rendered some service to the military at the
siege of Newport.</p>

<p>“Mr Justice Rooke summed up the evidence; after which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
the jury retired for about three-quarters of an hour, when
they returned a verdict of <i>Manslaughter</i>.</p>

<p>“The prisoner, having fled from the laws of his country
for twelve years, the Court was disposed to show no lenity.
He was, therefore, sentenced to pay a fine of one shilling,
and be imprisoned in Newgate for twelve months.”</p>

<p>We have a terrible instance in a man, otherwise amiable
in all relations of life, of the infatuation for the Turf. Lord
Foley, who died July 2, 1793, entered upon the Turf with
an estate of £18,000 a year, and £100,000 ready money.
He left it with a ruined constitution, an incumbered estate,
and not a shilling of ready money!</p>

<p>Here are three paragraphs from the <i>Times</i> about this date
relative to racing:</p>

<p><i>17th April 1794.</i> “Poor <i>Newmarket</i> is completely done
up! The Spring meeting boasts so few bets in the calendar
of gambling, that the chance will not pay post chaise hire to
the black legs. Thus falls the destructive sport of the Turf&mdash;and,
as that is the case, it would do honour to his Majesty
to change the <i>Kings Plates</i> into rewards for the <i>improvement
of Agriculture</i>.” This suggestion has been carried out
in the present reign.</p>

<p><i>25th May 1795.</i> “The Duke of Queensberry was a
principal loser at Epsom Races. The noble Duke had his
vis-a-vis, and six horses, driving about the course, with two
very pretty <i>emigrées</i> in it. The Duke was in his cabriolet.
The Duke of Bedford, Lords Egremont and Derby were,
also, on the course. Several carriages were broken to pieces;
and one Lady had her arm broken.</p>

<p>“There was much private business done in the <i>swindling
way</i> at the last Epsom Races. One black legged fellow
cleared near a thousand pounds by the old trick of an E.O.
Table. Another had a <i>faro table</i>, and was on the eve of
<i>doing business</i>, when he was detected with a <i>palmed card</i>:
almost the whole of what may be justly styled the ‘vagabond
gamblers’ of London were present.</p>

<p>“Mr Bowes, half brother of the Earl of Strathmore, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
robbed of a gold watch, and a purse containing 30 guineas,
at Epsom races, on Thursday last. Many other persons
shared a similar fate, both on the same evening, and Friday.
Upwards of 30 carriages were robbed, coming from the
races.”</p>

<p><i>8th Sep. 1797.</i> “Never, since <i>racing</i> was patronised by
the <i>Merry Monarch</i>, has the Turf been so much on the
decline as at this period. His Grace of Bedford is the only
person who retains a considerable stud. Lord Grosvenor
has disposed of nearly the whole of his, with the reserve of
two, or three, capital horses, and some few brood mares.”</p>

<p class="pch">Match between Mrs Thornton and Mr Flint&mdash;Its sequel&mdash;Daniel Dawson poisons
horses&mdash;Origin of Bookmaking&mdash;Turf frauds&mdash;The “Ludlow” scandal&mdash;The
“Plenipo” fraud&mdash;Reports of Select Committee on Gaming, 1844.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="beg">The</span> singular contest which took place between Mrs Thornton<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
and Mr Flint in 1804 was the talk of its time. An
intimacy existed between the families of Col. Thornton and
Mr Flint, the two ladies being sisters. In the course of one
of their rides in Thornville Park, the lady of Colonel Thornton
and Mr Flint were conversing on the qualities of their
respective horses; the difference of opinion was great, and
the horses were occasionally put at full speed for the purpose
of ascertaining the point in question; old Vingarillo,
on whom the lady rode, distancing his antagonist every time.
Which so discomforted Mr Flint, that he was induced to
challenge the lady to ride on a future day. The challenge
was readily accepted, and it was agreed that the race should
take place on the last day of the York August meeting
1804. This curious match was announced in the following
manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>“A match for 500 gs., and 1000 gs. bye&mdash;four miles&mdash;between
Colonel Thornton’s Vingarillo and Mr Flint’s br. h.
Thornville by Volunteer&mdash;Mrs Thornton to ride her weight
against Mr Flint’s.”</p>

<p>On Sunday, August the 25th, this race took place, and
the following description of it appeared in the <i>York
Herald</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Never did we witness such an assemblage of people as
were drawn together on the above occasion&mdash;100,000, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
least. Nearly ten times the number appeared on Knavesmire
than did on the day when Bay Malton ran, or when
Eclipse went over the course, leaving the two best horses of
the day a mile and a half behind. Indeed, expectation was
raised to the highest pitch, from the novelty of the match.
Thousands from every part of the surrounding country
thronged to the ground. In order to keep the course as
clear as possible, several additional people were employed;
and, much to the credit of the 6th Light Dragoons, a party
of them, also, were on the ground on horseback, for the purpose,
and which, unquestionably, was the cause of many
lives being saved.</p>

<p>“About four o’clock, Mrs Thornton appeared on the
ground, full of spirit, her horse led by Colonel Thornton,
and followed by two gentlemen; afterwards appeared Mr
Flint. They started a little past four o’clock. The lady
took the lead for upwards of three miles, in most capital
style: her horse, however, had much the shorter stroke of
the two. When within a mile of being home, Mr Flint
pushed forward, and got the lead, which he kept. Mrs
Thornton used every exertion; but, finding it impossible to
win the race, she drew up, in a sportsmanlike style, when
within about two distances.</p>

<p>“At the commencement of the running, bets were 5 and
6 to 4 on the lady; in running the first three miles 7 to 4
and 2 to 1 in her favour. Indeed, the oldest sportsman on
the stand thought she must have won. In running the last
mile the odds were in favour of Mr Flint. Never, surely,
did a woman ride in better style. It was difficult to say
whether her horsemanship, her dress, or her beauty, were
most admired&mdash;the <i>tout ensemble</i> was <i>unique</i>. Her dress
was a leopard-coloured body, with blue sleeves, the rest buff
and blue cap. Mr Flint rode in white. The race was run
in nine minutes and fifty-nine seconds.</p>

<p>“Thus ended the most interesting race ever ran upon
Knavesmire. No words could express the disappointment
felt at the defeat of Mrs Thornton. The spirit she displayed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
and the good humour with which she bore her loss,
greatly diminished the joy, even of the winners.”</p>

<p>This exhibition of herself seems to have fired her ambition,
for we read in the <i>Morning Post</i>, Aug. 20, 1805:</p>

<p>“Mrs Thornton is to ride 9 st. against Mr Bromford, who
is to ride 13 st. over the York Course, four miles; to run
the last race on Saturday in the next August meeting, for
four hogsheads of Coti Roti p.p. and 2000 guineas h. ft.;
and Mrs T. bets Mr B. 700 gs. to 600 gs. p.p.; the 2000
gs. h. ft. provided it is declared to the Stewards four days
before starting, Mrs T. to have the choice of four horses.</p>

<p>“Mr B. to ride Allegro, sister to Allegranti.</p>

<p>“<i>N.B.</i>, Colonel T., or any gentleman he may name, to be
permitted to follow the lady over the course, to assist her in
case of any accident.”</p>

<p>But, on the eventful 24th Aug., for some reason or other,
Mr Bromford declined the race, paid forfeit, and the lady
cantered over the course. Later in the day she really had
a race, which is thus described in the <i>Annual Register</i>:</p>

<p>“Afterwards commenced a match, in which the above
lady was to ride two miles against Mr Buckle, the jockey,
well known at Newmarket, and other places of sport, as a
rider of the first celebrity. Mrs Thornton appeared dressed
for the contest in a purple cap and waistcoat, nankeen
coloured skirts, purple shoes and embroidered stockings;
she was in high health and spirits, and seemed eager for the
decision of the match. Mr Buckle was dressed in a blue
cap, with a blue bodied jacket, and white sleeves. Mrs
Thornton carried 9 st. 6 lb., Mr Buckle 13 st. 6 lbs. At
half-past three they started. Mrs Thornton took the lead,
which she kept for some time; Mr Buckle then put in trial
his jockeyship, and passed the lady, which he kept for only
a few lengths, when Mrs Thornton, by the most excellent
horsemanship, pushed forward, and came in, in a style far
superior to anything of the kind we ever witnessed, gaining
her race by half a neck; and, on her winning, she was hailed
with the most reiterated shouts of congratulation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>“A sad disturbance took place, in the stand, in the afternoon,
in consequence of a dispute between Mr Flint (who
rode against Mrs Thornton last year) and Colonel Thornton,
respecting £1000. Mr Flint had posted the Colonel on
Thursday, and the Colonel recriminated on Friday. This
day, Mr Flint came to the stand with a new horse whip,
which he applied to the Colonel’s shoulders with great
activity, in the presence of a crowd of ladies. All the
gentlemen in the place, indignant at this gross and violent
outrage, hissed and hooted him. He was arrested by order
of the Lord Mayor and several magistrates, who were present,
and given into custody of the City runners, until he
can find bail, himself in £1000, and two sureties in £500
each. Colonel Thornton is also bound over to prosecute the
party for the assault.”</p>

<p>The sequel to this story is told in the same Magazine, 5th
Feb. 1806. “In the Court of King’s Bench, an application
was made on behalf of Colonel Thornton, for leave to file a
criminal information against Mr Flint, for challenging him
to fight a duel, and horse-whipping him on the race ground
at York last summer, &amp;c. The quarrel arose out of a bet of
1500 guineas which Mr Flint claims to have won of Colonel
Thornton by the race he rode against Mrs Thornton, whose
bets were adopted by her husband. Whereas Colonel
Thornton maintains that, of the bet alluded to, £1000 was
a mere nominal thing, intended to attract company to the
race, and that nothing more than 500 guineas were seriously
intended by the parties. After a full hearing of the whole
case, Lord Ellenborough was of opinion, that the case before
the Court was one in which their Lordships ought not to
interpose with its extraordinary power. On the contrary,
he conceived it would be degrading its process to interfere
in favour of such parties in such a cause. Colonel Thornton
had chosen to appeal to the Jockey Club, and should have
abided by their decision. He had, however, not found them
exactly fitting his notion of justice; and, therefore, for every
thing that had happened since, he must have recourse to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
ordinary mode of obtaining redress, namely, by preferring a
Bill of Indictment at the Sessions of the County. The other
judges being of the same opinion, the rule was discharged.”
Flint afterwards became very poor, and was manager at a
horse bazaar at York, where he met with his end, according
to the Coroner’s jury’s verdict&mdash;“Died from taking too large
a dose of prussic acid as a medicine.”</p>

<p>We now come to a piece of rascality on the turf, which
ended in a man being hanged. The first heard about it is
reported in the <i>Annual Register</i>, 6th May 1811. “An
occurrence has taken place at Newmarket, which is the subject
of general consternation and surprise among the frequenters
of the Turf. Several horses were entered for the
Claret Stakes, and, as usual, were taken out in the morning
for exercise. They all drank, as we understand, at one water
trough. Some time after they had been watered, six of
them were observed to stagger, and then to roll about in the
greatest agony. One is since dead. On examining the
watering trough, it was found that the water had been
poisoned. The horses were the property of Mr Sitwell, Sir
F. Standish, and Lord Kinnaird. Suspicion has attached
upon one of the jockies.”</p>

<p><i>22nd July, 1812.</i> “Daniel Dawson was arraigned at the
Cambridge Assizes, on an indictment, with numerous counts,
viz., for poisoning a horse belonging to Mr Adams, of
Royston, Herts, and a blood mare belonging to Mr Northey,
at Newmarket, in 1809; and, also, for poisoning a horse
belonging to Sir F. Standish, and another belonging to
Lord Foley in 1811, at the same place. He was tried and
convicted on the first case only.</p>

<p>“The principal witness was Cecil Bishop, an accomplice
with the prisoner. He had been, for some time, acquainted
with Dawson, and on application to him, had furnished him
with corrosive sublimate to sicken horses. He went on to
prove that Dawson and he had become progressively acquainted;
and, that, on the prisoner complaining that the
stuff was not strong enough, he prepared him a solution of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
arsenic. Witness described this as not offensive in smell;
the prisoner having informed him that the horses had thrown
up their heads, and refused to partake of the water into
which the corrosive sublimate had been infused. The
prisoner complained that the stuff was not strong enough;
and, on being informed that if it was made strong it would
kill the horses, he replied that he did not mind that; the
Newmarket frequenters were rogues, and if he (meaning
witness) had a fortune to lose they would plunder him of it.
The prisoner afterwards informed witness he used the stuff,
which was then strong enough, as it had killed a hackney
and two brood mares.</p>

<p>“Mrs Tillbrook, a housekeeper at Newmarket, where
the prisoner lodged, proved having found a bottle of liquid
concealed under Dawson’s bed, previous to the horses having
been poisoned; and that Dawson was out late on the
Saturday and Sunday evenings previous to that event, which
took place on the Monday. After Dawson had left the
house, she found the bottle, which she identified as having
contained the said liquid, and which a chemist proved to
have contained poison. Witness also proved that Dawson
had cautioned her that he had poison in the house for some
dogs, lest anyone should have the curiosity to taste it.
Other witnesses proved a chain of circumstances which left
no doubt of the prisoner’s guilt.</p>

<p>“Mr King, for the prisoner, took a legal objection that no
criminal offence had been committed, and that the subject
was a matter of trespass. He contended that the indictment
must fail, as it was necessary to prove that the
prisoner had malice against the owner of the horse, to
impoverish him, and not against the animal. He also
contended that the object of the prisoner was to injure and
not to kill. The objections was overruled without reply,
and the prisoner was convicted.</p>

<p>“The judge pronounced sentence of death on the prisoner,
and informed him, in strong language, he could not expect
mercy to be extended to him:” and the man was duly hanged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>Another gruesome episode of the Turf was the suicide of
Mr Roger Brograve early in June 1813, owing to losses by
betting. He was the brother of Sir George Brograve, and
had been a captain in the 2nd Dragoons, and for some years
had betted heavily. Originally, he had a competent, if not
a splendid fortune, but, at the previous Newmarket meeting,
he had lost heavily, and he was known to have lost £10,000
on the Derby. This he could not meet, and he shot himself.
Hundreds of similar cases might be given, but this
one must serve as an example. That large sums were
wagered and lost and won at this time we may learn from
the fact that in 1816 no less a sum than £300,000 is said
to have been paid and received at Tattersall’s in the betting
settlement on that year’s Epsom races.</p>

<p>Of the origin of bookmaking, Mr Dixon (The Druid) has
written so well in <i>The Post and the Paddock</i>, that I cannot
do better than copy him <i>verbatim</i>:</p>

<p>“Betting between one and the field was the fashion
which Turf speculation assumed in the days of powder and
periwigs, and Ogden (the only betting man who was ever
admitted to the Club at Newmarket), Davies, Holland,
Deavden, Kettle, Bickham, and Watts, ruled on the Turf
‘Change. With Jem Bland, Jerry Cloves, Myers (an ex-butler),
Richard (the Leicester Stockinger), Mat Milton,
Tommy Swan of Bedale (who never took or laid but one
bet on a Sunday), Highton, Holliday, Gully, Justice, Crockford,
Briscoe, Crutch Robinson, Ridsdale, Frank Richardson,
and Bob Steward, etc., the art of bookmaking arose, and,
henceforward, what had been more of a pastime among
owners, who would back their horses for a rattler when the
humour took them, and not shrink from having £5000 to
£6000 on a single match, degenerated into a science. All
the above, with the exception of two, have passed away,
like the Mastodons, never to return. Nature must have
broken the mould in which she formed the crafty Robinson,
as he leant on his crutch, with his back against the outer
wall of the Newmarket Betting Rooms, and, with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
knowing, quiet leer, and one hand in his pocket, offered
to ‘lay agin Plenipo.’</p>

<p>“The two Blands, Joe and ‘Facetious Jemmy,’ were
equally odd hands. Epsom had fired up the latter’s desire
to come on to the turf, and he descended from his coachman’s
box at Hedley for that purpose, and sported his ‘noble
lord’ hat, white cords, deep bass voice, and vulgar dialect,
on it, for the first time, about 1812. He did not trouble it
much after he had ‘dropped his sugar’ on Shillelah, though
that <i>contretemps</i> did not completely knock him out of time.
His acute rough expressions, such as ‘<i>never coomed anigh</i>,’
and so on, as well as his long nose, and white, flabby cheeks,
made him a man of mark, even before he got enough, by
laying all round, to set up a mansion in Piccadilly. Joe, his
brother, had, originally, been a post boy, and rose from
thence to be a stable keeper in Great Wardour Street; but,
the great hit of his life was his successful farming of turnpike
gates, at which he was supposed to have made about
£25,000. ‘Ludlow Bond’ was not so coarse in his style as
this <i>par nobile</i>, but ambitious and vain to the last degree.
It was the knowledge of this latter quality, on the part of
Ludlow’s real owners, ‘the Yorkshire Blacksmith &amp; Co.,’
which induced them to put him forward as the ostensible
owner of the horse, as no one would back a horse which was
known to be theirs. Bond liked the notoriety which this
nominal ownership conferred on him, and was, no doubt, a
mere puppet, without exactly knowing who pulled the
strings. Discreditable as the affair was, he always gloried
in it; in fact he was so determined not to let the memory
of it die out, that he christened a yearling which he bought
from the Duke of Grafton, ‘Ludlow Junior.’ At times he
appeared on the heath on a grey hack, and went by the nickname
of ‘<i>Death on the Pale Horse</i>’ and, shortly after the
Doncaster outburst, he came on in a handsome travelling
carriage, with two servants in livery in the rumble.</p>

<p>“Mr Gully, although he did great execution at the Corner
in Andover’s year, may be styled a mere fancy bettor now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
and, as a judge of racing and the points of a horse combined,
he has scarcely a peer among his own, or the younger
generation of turfites. His fame at the Corner was at its
zenith a quarter of a century ago, when he was a betting
partner with Ridsdale. Rumour averred that they won
£35,000 on Margrave for the St Leger (1832), and £50,000
on St Giles for the Derby; and it was in consequence of a
dispute as to the Margrave winnings, that the Siamese link
between them was so abruptly dissolved. Their joint books
also showed a balance of £80,000 if Red Rover could only
have brought Priam to grief for the Derby. There was a
joke too, soon after this time, that Mr Gully and his friend
Justice descended on to Cheltenham, and so completely
cleaned out the local ring there, that the two did not even
think it worth while stopping for the second race day. One
of the lesser lights was found wandering moodily about the
ring on that day, and remarked to a sympathiser that he was
‘looking for the few half crowns that Gully and Justice had
condescended to leave.’”</p>

<p>In the second quarter of this century the Turf was getting
in a scandalous condition. A fair race was hardly known
for the St Leger, and, in 1827, Mameluke was got rid of by
a series of false starts. In 1832 was the Ludlow scandal,
just alluded to. This horse was the property of a man
named Beardsworth, who was such a rogue that no one
would bet on or against his horse, so it was apparently purchased
by Ephraim Bond, the keeper of a gambling house,
called the Athenæum Club, in St James’s Street. In reality
it was owned by four people, Beardsworth, Bond and his
brother, and a mysterious fourth party, whose name was not
divulged. Ludlow was beaten by Margrave, a horse owned
by Gully, the ex-prize fighter, who boldly accused Squire
Osbaldistone of being the unknown fourth owner of Ludlow.
The consequence was a duel, in which both combatants had
very narrow escapes; Gully especially, for his opponent’s
bullet went through his hat and ploughed a furrow in his
hair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1834 Plenipotentiary, or as it was called for brevity,
Plenipo, the favourite for the St Leger, was undoubtedly
“nobbled,” either by his owner, Batson, or his trainer, George
Paine, either of which were capable of any dishonourable
conduct.</p>

<p>There were, afterwards, many minor Turf scandals, but
they culminated in the Derby of 1844 which is known as
Running Rein’s Derby, which ran as a three-year-old, being
in reality four years. As this fraud was the subject of an
action, its story may be well told in the following synopsis of
the trial.</p>

<p class="pc mid"><span class="smcap">In the Exchequer.</span></p>

<p class="pc lmid"><i>July 1.</i></p>

<p class="pc lmid"><i>Before Mr Baron Alderson.</i></p>

<p class="pc lmid"><span class="smcap">Wood</span> <i>v.</i> <span class="smcap">Peel</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">This action, which excited the most lively interest in the
<i>Sporting World</i>, arose out of the late Derby race at Epsom,
in which a horse belonging to the plaintiff, called Running
Rein, had come in first. It was alleged, however, that this
horse had not been truly described, that he was not of the age
which qualified him to run for the Derby, and that he ought
not, therefore, to be deemed the winner of the race. Colonel
Peel, the owner of Orlando, the second horse, had claimed
the stakes, on the ground that Running Rein was not the
horse represented; and Mr Wood, the owner of Running
Rein, brought this action against the Colonel.</p>

<p>Mr Cockburn, who conducted the plaintiff’s case, gave the
pedigree of Running Rein, and his whole history. Among
other things, Mr Cockburn mentioned that, in October 1843,
Running Rein won a race at Newmarket; that he was objected
to on the score of age, but, eventually, the stewards
had decided in his favour. The horse was, originally, the
property of Mr Goodman; and, Mr Cockburn said, it was
because suspicion attached to some transactions of Goodman,
and because certain parties had betted heavily against Running
Rein, that opposition was raised against Mr Wood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
receiving the stakes. He made a severe attack on Lord
George Bentinck, who, he asserted, was the real party in the
cause. Witnesses for the plaintiff described the horse at various
periods of its career: it was of a bay colour, with black
legs, and a little white on the forehead; its heels were
cracked, and in 1842 it broke the skin on one leg, which
left a scar. George Hitchcock, a breaker of colts, employed
to break Running Rein in October 1842, was cross-examined
to this effect:</p>

<p>“I know George Dockeray, the trainer. I never said to
him, ‘Damn it, this colt has been broken before; here is the
mark of the pad on his back.’ I showed him the mark, but
I never said those words, or any words to that effect. I
don’t know why I showed him the mark. It was not big
enough for the mark of a pad, and it was not the place for
the saddle to make it. I told Lord George Bentinck the
same. The mark of the pad never wears out. I recollect
being asked, in the presence of Mr Smith, what had I there?
and I recollect answering, a four years’ old. I have not the
slightest doubt of it. Mr Smith struck me for it. I did not
say afterwards that I had forgotten all about the horse whipping,
and that the marks of the pad had worn out. I never
said, either, that somebody had behaved very well to me.”</p>

<p>At an early period of the examination of witnesses, Mr
Baron Alderson expressed a wish that he and the jury
should see the horse; and Mr Cockburn said he had no
objection. On the cross-examination of William Smith, a
training groom residing at Epsom, it came out that the horse
had been smuggled out of the way, that it might not be seen
by the defendant’s agents. The Judge, animadverting on
this, and on the evident perjury of the witness, said it would
be better that the horse should be seen by him and other
parties. The Solicitor-General, who appeared for the defendant,
was anxious that the horse should be seen by veterinary
surgeons. To which the other side objected, maintaining
that the mark of mouth, by which alone these surgeons
could judge of the age of a horse, was a fallible criterion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>On the conclusion of the evidence for the plaintiff, the
Solicitor-General, in addressing the jury for the defence,
denounced the case as a gross and scandalous fraud on the
part of the plaintiff. The case of the defendant was, that
the horse was not Running Rein at all, but a colt by
Gladiator, out of a dam belonging originally to Sir Charles
Ibbotson; and that it had the name Running Rein imposed
upon it, being originally called Maccabeus, and having been
entered for certain stakes under that designation. But his
allegations were against Goodman, not against Mr Wood:
the former had entered into a conspiracy with other persons
to run horses above the proper age. The Gladiator colt had
been entered for races, under the name of Maccabeus, before
Goodman purchased him; and to run these races while the
colt was in training for the Derby, for which he was entered
as Running Rein, Goodman hired an Irish horse, which he
disguised as Maccabeus, though a year older than that horse.
The Gladiator colt, the <i>soi distant</i> Running Rein, when he
ran for the Derby in 1844, was four years old, the race
being for three-year-old horses. After hearing some evidence
in support of these statements, the case was adjourned
till the following day.</p>

<p>The next day, when Mr Baron Alderson took his seat on
the Bench, a conversation ensued between Mr Cockburn and
the Judge, respecting the production of the horse. Mr
Cockburn asserted that it had been taken away without Mr
Wood’s knowledge, and thus it was out of his power to produce
it; he felt it would be vain to strive against the effect
which must be produced by the non-production of the horse,
after the remarks of the learned judge on that point. After
some more conversation, however, the case proceeded, and
two witnesses for the defence were examined, whose evidence
went to prove that Running Rein was, in fact, the Gladiator
colt. Mr George Odell, a horse dealer at Northampton,
said he could swear to that fact; the colt had two marks on
one leg.</p>

<p>Mr Baron Alderson remarked&mdash;“Now, if we could see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
horse, that would prove the case. Who keeps him away? It
is quite childish to act in this manner.”</p>

<p>Mr Cockburn now stated that Mr Wood was convinced
that he had been deceived, and gave up the case.</p>

<p>Mr Baron Alderson then briefly addressed the jury with
much warmth, and in a most emphatic manner; directing
them to find a verdict for the defendant, observing:</p>

<p>“Since the opening of the case, a most atrocious fraud
has been proved to have been practised; and I have seen,
with great regret, gentlemen associating themselves with
persons much below themselves in station. If gentlemen
would associate with gentlemen, and race with gentlemen,
we should have no such practises. But, if gentlemen will
condescend to race with blackguards, they must expect to
be cheated.”</p>

<p>The jury found for the defendant, and the effect of their
verdict was that the Derby Stakes went to Orlando, and
that Crenoline should be considered the winner of the Two-Year-Old
Plate at Newmarket, run the previous year.</p>

<p>This ought to have been sufficient roguery, one would
think, for one race, but it was not. A horse named Ratan
was so evidently “nobbled,” that two men connected with it,
Rogers and Braham, were warned off all the Jockey Club’s
premises.</p>

<p>And yet another case. A horse named Leander ran in
this race, and so injured its leg that it was shot. Shortly
afterwards, it was suspected that it was four instead of three
years old, and on its being exhumed, <i>the lower jaw was
missing</i>. The resurrectionists, however, cut off the head,
and veterinary experts confirmed the previous suspicions.
For this, the owners, Messrs Lichtwald, were for ever disqualified
from racing. This case occupied much time before
the Select Committee of the House of Lords.</p>

<p>The Select Committee on Gaming in the Commons in
1844 report that “Your Committee have some evidence to
show that frauds are, occasionally, committed in Horse racing,
and in Betting on the Turf; but they feel difficulty in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
suggesting any remedy for this evil, more stringent, or more
likely to be effectual, than those already in existence.”</p>

<p>The House of Lords reported in similar terms, but they
added: “The Committee have inquired into certain transactions
which have, lately, been brought before the Courts
of Law, arising from the fraudulent practices of Individuals
substituting other horses for those named in stakes which
are limited to horses of a certain age, and thus obtaining the
advantages arising from running, at even weights, Three-year-olds
against Two-year-olds, and Four-year-olds against
Three-year-olds. The success, however, which has attended
the prosecutions instituted for the Recovery of the Stakes
thus unjustly won, and the rules which the Committee are
led to believe will be, hereafter, strictly attended to, as to
the examination, by competent persons, of all horses which
may be objected to, render it unnecessary for them to make
any further comment upon this part of their inquiry.”</p>

<p>But the Commons Committee reported on another subject,
the Gaming-houses in race towns, and the Gaming-booths
on the courses.</p>

<p>“The suppression of Gaming-houses in race towns, and in
other places out of the Metropolitan Police District, is to be
effected under the common law, and under the enactment of
Statutes different from the Metropolitan Police Act. Much
laxity and neglect have, hitherto, prevailed in this respect;
and your Committee think that the attention of Magistrates
might, usefully, be directed to this matter. But, if it should
be found that the powers given by the existing law are
insufficient, your Committee would recommend that additional
powers should be conferred.</p>

<p>“Your Committee have found that it is the practice on
some race courses to let out ground for the erection of
Gaming-booths, during the races, in order that the high
rents paid by the keepers of these booths may be added to
the fund from whence prizes to be run for are to be given;
and some of the witnesses examined have stated that certain
race meetings, which they have named, could not be kept
up, if this practice were to be discontinued.”</p>

before the Committee&mdash;Description of the betting-rooms at Doncaster
in 1846&mdash;Beginning of tipsters and betting-rooms.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="beg">This</span> system of gambling on race courses began the previous
century. In Canto I. of <i>The Gambler’s, A Poem</i>, Lon.
1777, we read:</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“But, chief, we see a bricking, sharping sort,<br />

<p class="p1">Complaints of racecourse gambling began early in the
present century. In the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> for 1801
(p. 327) we read: “Mr Urban&mdash;As the quarter sessions
will take place in most parts of England in the course of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
present month, I wish, through the medium of your extensively
circulated Magazine, to submit to the serious
consideration of the County Magistrates, the absolute
necessity for adopting some vigorous measures, in order to
check the career of those infamous swindlers, who are in
the constant habit of attending our fairs and races with
E.O. tables, &amp;c. It is an alarming fact that there is
scarcely a fair, or a race, of the least celebrity, which is not
infested with these villains, many of whom clear £500
annually by plundering the unsuspecting rustics, who attend
such places, of their property.”</p>

<p>Goldsmith, in his life of Beau Nash, tells us that E.O.
was first set up at Tunbridge, in the reign of George I.,
and was introduced into Bath by Nash: and, as the game
was a very popular one, I give the following description of
it, as found in Rice’s <i>History of the British Turf</i>:</p>

<p>“The E.O. table was circular in form, and, though made
in various sizes, was, commonly, four feet in diameter. The
outside edge formed the counter, or <i>depôt</i>, on which the
stakes were placed, and was marked all round with the
letters E.O. from which the game took its name. The
interior of the table consisted of a stationary gallery, in
which the ball rolled, and an independent round table,
moving on an axis, by means of handles. The ball was
started in one direction, and this rotary table turned in the
other. This part was divided into forty compartments of
equal size, twenty of which were marked E. and twenty O.
The principle was pretty much as that of roulette without
a zero; but the ingenuity of the proprietors appears, at an
early date in the history of these tables, to have supplied
this defect. At first the game was played on the same
terms as hazard then was, viz., whoever won, or threw in
three times successively, paid, when gold was played for,
half a guinea to the proprietors of the table. This, however,
as might have been expected, was too simple and
unsophisticated a method of procedure to last. The game
was too fair; but, as it was very popular, it must be made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
profitable to the man of business, who could not be expected
to travel from race meeting to race meeting all over the
country, for half guineas in cases of exceptional luck.
Accordingly, he became obliged to take all bets offered
either for E. or for O., and made two of his forty spaces
into ‘bar holes.’ The name sufficiently explains the utility
of the device to the keeper of the table. If the ball fell into
either of these ‘bar holes,’ he won all the bets on the
opposite letter, and did not pay to that on which it fell.
Unfair tables, having the compartments of one letter larger
than another, abounded; but there seems to have been little
necessity to cheat at the game, as, with a proportion of two
in forty, or five per cent., in his favour, the keeper should
have reaped a heavy harvest of profit from his venture.
The gentlemen who had played the game at the time
when the occasional half guinea was thought enough to
remunerate the proprietor, could hardly have liked the
innovation, regarding the five per cent. ‘pull’ against them
as ‘a circumstance which, in the long run, would infallibly
exhaust the <i>Exchequer</i>’ much more than the breeches
pockets of the young squires.</p>

<p>The booths at Ascot Heath, and the taverns in Windsor,
were, at race time, great haunts for the keepers of the E.O.
tables, some of whom were respectable men in their calling,
and might be trusted to give twenty, or even more, shillings
for a guinea; but the majority, gambling for twopenny
pieces and sixpences, were little, if anything, better than
the thimble-rig and prick-the-garter gentry of that, or the
three-card practitioners of our own, time. Ascot, indeed,
was, then, a race meeting of the first importance, and the
week was a fair of the most attractive character to the
Berkshire landlords and their tenantry. The Oatlands
Stakes was transferred to Newmarket from Ascot, after a
memorable race, when a hundred thousand pounds changed
hands; and we read that the Turf was a barren and dreary
prospect&mdash;for the losers. ‘Horses are daily thrown out of
training, jockeys are going into mourning, grooms are becoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
E.O. merchants, and strappers are going on the
highway.’”</p>

<p>In the <i>Quarterly Review</i> for 1834, a description is given
of gambling at races, as it then was. “Doncaster, Epsom,
Ascot, Warwick, and most of our numerous race grounds
and race towns are scenes of destructive and universal
gambling among the lower orders, which our absurdly lax
police never attempt to suppress; and yet, without the
slightest approach to an improperly harsh interference with
the pleasures of the people, the roulette and E.O. tables
which plunder the peasantry at these places, for the benefit
of travelling sharpers (certainly equally respectable with
some bipeds of prey who drive coroneted cabs near St
James’s), might be put down by any watchful magistrate.”</p>

<p>The Commons Select Committee on Gaming in 1844
tells us a great deal about the gambling at Doncaster,
during race meetings. A Mr Richard Baxter was the
witness, and he said:</p>

<p>“The extent to which gambling has been carried on,
both upon the course, and in the town of Doncaster, has
varied at different periods. Twenty years ago, in 1824,
was my first acquaintance with the matter: I went, as a
stranger, to live in Doncaster, and I found that there were
40 or 50 houses, and men stationed at the doors, and passing
up and down the streets, not only, by word, inviting the
passers by to go into those houses, but putting into their
hands cards (one of which I have here)&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p class="pn">&mdash;explanatory of the game that was going on there, and,
without any secrecy, or reserve, stating the name of the
party at whose house the game was carried on.</p>

<p>“Being a stranger in the town, I went into almost all the
houses, and found them playing, in some with dice, and
in some with balls, at the different games, the names of
all of which I do not know: but gambling was going on to
this extent, and no check to it, whatever, was put by the
local authorities. At the same time, upon the race course,
the thimble men were in hundreds, with their tables, as well
as by the roadsides on every approach to Doncaster, playing,
and cheating the people out of their money, as fast as they
could induce them to play. As I was a stranger in the
place, I did not think it becoming in me, at that time, to
interfere; and, for two years following, I did no more than
speak upon the subject to the mayor and the magistrates,
and the gentlemen of the town, urging them to take some
means to repress this systematic gambling; but, in the year
1827, which was the third year, finding that the authorities
would take no notice of it, I laid an information against one
of the gambling houses, against Henry Oldfield, who is a
very noted character in gambling. I brought the owner of
the house, who is a very respectable tradesman in the town;
I brought the sister of the owner and his servants; I brought
the man who attended at the door, and invited people
publicly, ‘Roulette and Hazard going on upstairs’; I
brought a gentleman, a respectable surgeon of the town,
who had been in the room, and played there. Those parties
I brought before the magistrates, they were examined upon
oath. The owner of the house denied all knowledge of the
object for which the room was let; the gentleman, who had
been present, owned that he had played, but denied his
knowledge of the name of the game at which he played;
and, the result was, that the magistrates refused to convict.
No further step was taken in that year; but, in the following
year, without again speaking to the authorities, I represented
the matter to the neighbouring gentry, and the present Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Fitzwilliam, Mr Beckett Denison, one of the Members for
the West Riding; Mr Childers, the Member for Malton; and,
perhaps, 20 or 30 other gentlemen, in the neighbourhood,
and in the town, joined in an association, professedly, to
repress gambling in the town. The rules of the association
were, that application should be made to the local authorities,
and such legal means taken, as could be made available
to induce the authorities to repress gambling. This was
most respectably supported and published. The consequence
was, that we had an <i>émeute</i> in the town: the inhabitants
assembled at a public meeting, a gentleman, who
is, now, one of the Borough Magistrates, was put into the
chair, and a regular set of speeches made against the Anti-Gambling
Association, and all parties concerned. I thought
it my duty to go to the meeting; and, of course, you may
suppose, was very warmly received. I told them, very
candidly and freely, my mind upon the subject. They
heard me for a certain length of time; but, finding the
chairman refused to let me go on, I left the meeting, and
had the honour of being pelted down the street on my way
home, as a recompense for the advice I had taken the liberty
of tendering them. The consequence of this <i>émeute</i> was,
that our association fell to pieces. I am sorry to say, that
the members who composed it did not choose, in the face of
the unpopularity which it occasioned, to take any further
step in it.</p>

<p class="ptb2 p1">······</p>

<p class="p1">“The extent of gambling in Doncaster for the last two or
three years has been from six to twelve of the lower gambling
houses and three of the higher gambling houses. The distinction
between the one class and the other consists in this:
that the lower gambling houses are kept by men who hire a
little front shop, open to the street, for the purpose of taking
mere passers-by; the higher gambling houses, many of them
houses of their own, which they have built in Doncaster, for
the purpose of gaming; a third class hire rooms of respectable
tradesmen in the town, and occupy them; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
popular opinion is, that there are clubs, and knots of gentlemen
attached to each of those houses, who regularly go and
play there. Oldfield, against whom the information was laid
in 1827, was the keeper of one of the higher gambling
houses, and I need scarcely state to the Committee that,
popular as gambling is in the town, very strong remarks are
made and a very strong feeling exists in the place, that, if
the lower gambling houses are suppressed, it is unfair to the
common people that the higher gambling houses should be
permitted to continue; and, when an information is laid
against the low gambling houses, it is always matter of
crimination; ‘Why did you not lay it against the gentlemen’s
houses? you are laying it against the houses of the poor
people, but you will not lay it against the houses of the
gentlemen.’ Another circumstance connected with the races
I may mention as a great public nuisance is, that the betting
room, which is a building erected simply for the purpose of
betting, is open on a Sunday, to the public, as on any other
day, and during the time of Divine service in the evening
more people, I am sorry to say, are assembled at the betting
rooms than at church; and there is a continual crowd filling
half the street in front of the betting rooms the whole of the
Sunday evening. A representation on the subject was made
to the Chief Magistrate at the time, and the only answer we
got to the representation to him was that he would communicate
with the parties and endeavour to have it closed: it
was closed during the morning and afternoon services, but it
was open to the public, as before, during the evening service,
and hundreds of those who are called gentlemen were
assembled there betting, and all the affairs of the races going
on quite as publicly as on any other evening of the week.</p>

<p>“1024.&mdash;With regard to gambling on the race course,
whether by thimble-riggers, or by roulette, or any other
kind of gambling, whether in booths or not, are the Committee
to understand that that has of late years entirely
ceased to exist?&mdash;That has been suppressed.</p>

<p>“1025.&mdash;By the interference of the police?&mdash;Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>A Mr John Rushbridger, who had charge of the ground at
Goodwood, on which the races were held, was examined, and
he deposed that there were only two gambling booths on the
course, which paid £125 each for the privilege; whilst
refreshment booths were only charged 10s. or 15s. They
endeavoured, as far as possible, to keep thimble-riggers off
the course.</p>

<p>The Clerk of the Course at Egham said there used to
be eighteen gambling booths on the course, but now there
were only fourteen, which produced a rental of £240; but a
portion of the grand stand was let for gambling purposes,
and that brought in a further sum. The thimble-rigmen
were allowed on the course, as far as the distance-post, and
formerly used to pay for the permission.</p>

<p>A Timothy Barnard was examined, and said he speculated
in race courses. At Egham he paid the Lord of the Manor
£300 for the race course, and cleared £240 by the gambling
booths. He gave £600 for Epsom course, but could not
give £300 if he were deprived of the privilege of letting
gaming booths, because they were the mainstay of the other
booths, such as the publicans’ booths; many having their
liquors and wines of them, and therefore the publicans would
not give near as much for the ground, except for those booths.
They made the thimble-riggers pay 5s. or 10s. to be allowed
on the course; they were given a little ticket which they
were obliged to wear in their hats, or their tables would be
taken from them.</p>

<p>In <i>Bentley’s Magazine</i> for 1846 we get a good account of
the working of the betting rooms at Doncaster. The subscription
was a guinea, and the number of subscribers was
from 1000 to 1200. “The rent paid by the proprietary for
the premises is said to be £500 per an.; but this is reduced
in its amount by the circumstance of the rooms being let off
for trading, or warehouse purposes, during ten months of the
year; and taking this reduction at the reasonable sum of
£150, it would leave £350 as the rent from the estimated
subscriptions of £1050, which would give a clear surplus of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
£700 per an., which alone would be a large return of profit.
But other sources of income and annual return are open to
the proprietary, by the sale of wine, spirits, soda water, and
divers refreshments, which are in almost constant demand in
the great room throughout each evening, and partially so in
the day. The prices at which these articles are sold are by
no means so moderate as they might be, even to secure a
fair and liberal compensation for their outlay, and must, on
the most moderate calculation, yield £100 clear at least in
the week.</p>

<p>“But the <i>El Dorado</i> or grand source of income and wealth
to the proprietors arises from the prolific revenue of the play
or gaming tables, of which there are usually six in constant
nightly operation during the racing week. The proprietors
of the Subscription Betting Rooms are not ostensibly connected
in the co-partnership of the banks, or in the business
of the tables, but they are nevertheless largely interested in
the successful issue of the week, as will be shown. In the
first instance it should be stated that the sum of £350 or
£400 is <i>paid down</i> to them by the party contracting for the
tables and for the privilege of putting down the banks. This
is all clear profit, paid in advance and without any contingency;
and in addition to this apparently large sum, so paid
for the mere privilege of finding capital, there is a stipulation
also on the part of the proprietors of the rooms that they
shall receive a considerable part or share of the whole clear
profits, or gains, of the week accruing from the tables, and
this without the risk of a single shilling by them under any
unlooked-for reverse of fortune.</p>

<p class="ptb2 p1">······</p>

<p class="p1">“The play tables at the Betting Rooms, are, as before
noted, six, or seven, in number, and of variety in the games
played thereat. The roulette tables attract the crowd, as
well as for the reason that the game opens to the player
many modes of proportionate risk, as that it affords him
opportunity to play smaller sums on any one event, than he
can at hazard. At the former game, the lowest stake is half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
a crown; at the latter, nothing less than the regal coin of a
sovereign is permitted. The pull, or percentage, of roulette
against the player, being, however, nearly five times that of
hazard, the small stakes played realise as large a result to
the bankers. It requires all the vigilance of a player to
guard his interests at this game; for, generally speaking,
there is much confusion in the distribution of money staked
by the many adventurers, on the numbers, and other points
of speculation attaching to the game; and dispute, not
infrequently, arises between two or three different claimants
for the produce of some fortunate, or winning result. These
contested claims often arise from inattention in the player
to the exact position of his money on the board, but are,
sometimes, occasioned by the attempt of some sharping
knave to possess himself of something which does not belong
to him. The officials at the table, too, are most dexterous
in their practical avocations,&mdash;more particularly so in the
principle of drawing the money from the losing points of
the game, immediately the winning number, &amp;c., is called.
The rapidity with which this operation is performed, is most
remarkable, and gives immense additional advantage to the
bank; for, it very often happens that, in the general sweep,
the adroit croupiers rake off much more than they are
entitled to; while, on the other hand, they can never, under
any circumstances, be called upon to pay more than the
loss attaching to the event.”</p>

<p>Doncaster is now, I believe, very much purified, but Sir
George Chetwynd describes the gambling that went on
there in 1869. “How changed is Doncaster now, from
what it was in those days! Then, after dinner, you would
go to the subscription rooms and back horses for the Cesarewitch
and Cambridgeshire at 100 to 1 to win large stakes,
and even small bookmakers thought nothing of starting
£20,000 books. After making their bets, people used to
go into an inner room where hazard was being played. Hour
after hour the game continued in full swing at a table crowded
with punters, with green, black, red and white ivory counters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
before them denoting £10, £5, £25, and £1. There was an
impressive stillness in the room, only broken by the voice of
Mr F. Hall, one of the croupiers, who, rake in hand, gave
vent to such utterances as, ‘The Castor is backing in at
seven, gentlemen. I’ll take on the nick.’ Then came the
rattle of the dice, the bang on the table of the box, the
quick announcement of the point, and the raking in of the
counters on the losing columns, by the two croupiers, one of
whom looked like a respectable tradesman, or a magistrate’s
clerk. Behind the players stood the proprietor, a tall, handsome
man, with carefully trimmed white beard and moustache,
more like a general than the keeper of a hell; his countenance
immovable, except when it relaxed, as he replied courteously
to any one who addressed him.</p>

<p>“He is dead, so is one of the croupiers, so are half the
players, old and young, whom I first saw at the table twenty
years ago, when, for the first time, I was initiated into the
mysteries of hazard, how to dash down a ten, or dribble a
four, as if, really, there was skill about a game which consists
in rattling two dice in a box, and winning, or losing by the
points they declare when rolled out on the table.”</p>

<p>We have seen how disreputable the Turf had become in
1844. If anything, it became worse. A class of men
sprung up, called “tipsters,” men who pretended to have
exclusive and particular stable information which they were
willing to impart to their dupes, say (to quote the advertisement
of one of the fraternity), Single events, 3s. 6d. Derby
or Oaks, 5s. each: yearly subscription, 21s.; half yearly,
10s. 6d. That these men made a profitable business of it,
there can be no doubt, for the sporting papers were full of
their advertisements, some of them of great length: and,
then, also began that curse attending horse racing, the
betting shop&mdash;which afforded a fatal facility to all classes,
to gamble, and which led to crime, and its attendant
punishment.</p>

<p>In 1852, these houses had become such a crying scandal,
that a public meeting was held on 18th June, at the Literary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
and Scientific Institution in Aldersgate Street, over which
Sir Peter Laurie presided, to adopt measures for the suppression
of betting houses in the City of London, and a resolution
was moved, and carried unanimously, that a petition be
presented to Parliament for their suppression. In the same
year, at a meeting of the Aldermen at the Guildhall, the
foreman of the Inquest of Farringdon Ward Without,
handed in a presentment, which he said related to a subject
of great importance in the City of London; the gambling
and betting houses in the Ward, by which great mischief
was done. Facilities were given at these houses, of which
there were a great number in the Ward, for betting, from
sums of threepence, or fourpence upwards; and by these
means, many servants and boys, who certainly had no money
of their own to bet with, were induced to lay wagers that
too often led them into a career of crime.</p>

<p><i>The Druid</i> says: “The great list era, and all its
attendant Ripe-for-a-jails, as <i>Punch</i> termed them, began
with Messrs Drummond and Greville, who ‘kept an
account at the Westminster Bank’ in 1847. Up to that
time ‘sweeps,’ where every subscriber drew a horse for
his ticket, had been amply sufficient to satisfy the popular
thirst for speculation on a Derby, or St Leger eve; and,
although, in one instance, we ascertained that our ticket
horse was a leader in a Shrewsbury coach, instead of being
‘prepared,’ it was satisfactory to know that there was, at
least, fair play. Stimulated by the example of D. and G.,
the licensed victuallers took it up&mdash;and a nice mess they
made of it&mdash;till the licensing magistrates stepped sternly
in. From 1850 to the end of 1853, the listers were in their
glory; and, at one period, about four hundred betting houses
were open in London alone, of which, perhaps, ten were
solvent.”</p>

<p class="pch">Betting Houses&mdash;Their suppression in 1853&mdash;Bookmakers and their Clients&mdash;Defaulters&mdash;Dwyer’s
swindle&mdash;Value of Stakes.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="beg">In</span> <i>Chambers’ Edinburgh Journal</i> of 24th July 1852, is
an excellent article on “<span class="smcap">Betting Houses</span>.” It says:
“‘Betting Shop’ is vulgar, and we dislike vulgarity.
‘Commission Office,’ ‘Racing Bank,’ ‘Mr Hopposite Green’s
Office,’ ‘Betting Office,’ are the styles of announcement
adopted by speculators, who open, what low people call,
Betting Shops. The chosen designation is, usually, painted
in gold letters on a chocolate coloured wire gauze blind,
impervious to the view. A betting office may display on its
small show board, two bronzed plaster horses, rampant, held
by two Ethiopian figures, nude; or it may prefer making a
show of cigars. Many offices have risen out of simple
cigar shops. When this is the case, the tobacco business
gives way, the slow trade and fast profession not running
well together. An official appearance is always considered
necessary. A partition, therefore, sufficiently high not to
be peered over, runs midway across the shop, surmounted
with a rail. By such means, visions are suggested to the
intelligent mind, of desks, and clerks. In the partition is
an enlarged <i>pigeon</i> hole&mdash;not far off, may be supposed to
lurk the hawk&mdash;through which are received shillings, half
crowns; in fact, any kind of coin or notes, no sum appearing
inadmissible. The office is papered with a warm crimson
paper to make it snug and comfortable, pleasant as a lounge,
and casting a genial glow upon the proceedings.</p>

<p>“But the betting lists are the attraction&mdash;these are the
dice of the betting men; a section of one of the side walls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
within the office is devoted to them. They consist of long
slips of paper&mdash;each race having its own slip&mdash;on which are
stated the odds against the horses. Hasty and anxious are
the glances which the speculator casts upon betting lists;
there he sees which are the favourites, whether those he has
backed are advancing, or retrograding, and he endeavours to
discover, by signs and testimonies, by all kinds of movements
and dodges, the knowing one’s opinion. He will
drop fishing words to other gazers, will try to overhear
whispered remarks, will sidle towards any jockey-legged, or
ecurial-costumed individual, and aim more especially at
getting into the good graces of the betting office keeper,
who, when his business is slack, comes forth from behind the
partition, and from the duties of the pigeon hole, to stretch
his legs, and hold turf converse. The betting office keeper
is the speculator’s divinity.</p>

<p class="ptb2 p1">······</p>

<p>“There are various kinds of betting offices. Some are
speculative, May-fly offices, open to-day, and shut to-morrow&mdash;offices
that will bet any way, and against anything&mdash;that
will accommodate themselves to any odds&mdash;receive any sum
they can get, small or large; and, should a misfortune occur,
such as a wrong horse winning, forget to open next day.
These are but second rate offices. The money making,
prosperous betting office is quite a different thing. It is not
advisable for concerns which intend making thousands in a
few years, to pay the superintendents liberally, and to keep
well clothed touters&mdash;to conduct themselves, in short, like
speculative offices. They must not depend entirely upon
chance. Chance is very well for betting men, but will not
do for the respectable betting office keepers, who are the
stake holders.</p>

<p>“The plan adopted is a very simple one, but ingenious in
its simplicity. The betting office takes a great dislike in its
own mind to a particular horse, the favourite of the betting
men. It makes bets against that horse, which amounts, in
the aggregate, to a fortune; and then it <i>buys</i> the object of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
its frantic delight. This being effected, the horse, of course,
loses, and the office wins. How could it be otherwise?
Would you have a horse win against its owner’s interest?
The thing being settled, the office, in order to ascertain the
amount of its winnings, has only to deduct the price of the
horse from its aggregate bets, and arrange the remainder in
a line of, perhaps, five figures. Whereupon the betting men
grow seedier and more seedy: some of the more mercurial
go off in a fit of apoplectic amazement; some betake themselves
to Waterloo stairs on a moonless night; some proceed
to the diggings, some to St Luke’s, and some to the
dogs; some become so unsteady, that they sign the wrong
name to a draft, or enter the wrong house at night, or are
detected in a crowd with their hand in the wrong man’s
pocket. But, by degrees, everything comes right again.
The insane are shut up, the desperate transported, the dead
buried, the deserted families carted to the workhouse; and
the betting-office goes on as before.”</p>

<p>The scandal, however, grew too grave to be ignored, and
the Government took the matter up. On July 11, 1853,
the Attorney-General rose in his place in the House of
Commons, and said, he would now beg to move for leave to
bring in a Bill for the suppression of betting houses, and, in
doing so, he considered it was not necessary for him to make
any lengthened statement on the subject, as the evils which
had arisen from the introduction of these establishments
were perfectly notorious, and acknowledged upon all hands.
The difficulty, however, which arose in legislating upon this
subject, was the disinclination which was felt against interfering
with that description of betting which had so long
existed at Tattersall’s and elsewhere, in connection with the
great national sport of horse racing. But these establishments
assumed a totally different aspect&mdash;a new form
of betting was introduced, which had been productive of
the greatest evils. The course, now, is to open a house,
and for the owner to hold himself forth as ready to bet with
all comers, contrary to the usage which had prevailed at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
such places as Tattersall’s, where individuals betted with
each other, but no one there kept a gaming table, or, in
other words, held a bag against all comers. The object,
then, of this Bill, was to suppress these houses, without
interfering with that legitimate species of betting, to which
he had referred. It would prohibit the opening of houses,
or shops or booths, for the purpose of betting; and, inasmuch
as it appeared that the mischief of the existing vicious
system seemed to arise from the advancing of money, in the
first instance, with the expectation of receiving a larger sum
on the completion of a certain event, it was proposed to prohibit
the practice, by distinct legislative enactment. The
mischief arising from the existence of these betting shops
was perfectly notorious. Servants, apprentices, and workmen,
induced by the temptation of receiving a large sum for
a small one, took their few shillings to these places, and the
first effect of their losing, was to tempt them to go on spending
their money in the hope of retrieving their losses; and, for
this purpose, it not unfrequently happened that they were
driven into robbing their masters and employers. There
was not a prison, nor a house of correction in London,
which did not every day furnish abundant and conclusive
testimony of the vast number of youths who were led into
crime by the temptation of these establishments of which
there were from 100 to 150 in the metropolis alone, while
there were a considerable number in the large towns of the
provinces. He believed this bill would have the effect of
suppressing most of them; or, at all events, of preventing
the spread of an evil which was admitted on all hands. It
had been suggested that the more effectual course would be
the licensing of these houses; but, for his own part, he
believed that would be discreditable to the Government, and
would only tend to increase the mischief instead of preventing
it. He trusted and believed that the Bill which he now
sought to introduce would have the desired effect, and he
hoped the House would offer no objection to his bringing
it in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>Leave was given, and the Bill was so in accord with the
feeling of the House, that it went through all its stages
without debate, and received the Royal Assent on 20th Aug.
1853, under the title of “An Act for the suppression of
Betting Houses,” 16 &amp; 17 Victoria, cap. 119: it became
operative on 1st Dec. 1853. Its principal clause is Sec. iii.,
which deals with the penalty on owner or occupier of Betting
House. “Any Person who, being the Owner, or Occupier
of any House, Office, Room, or other Place, or a Person
using the same, shall open, keep, or use the same for the
Purposes hereinbefore mentioned, or either of them; and
any Person, who, being the Owner, or Occupier, of any
House, Room, Office, or other Place, shall, knowingly, and
wilfully, permit the same to be opened, kept, or used by
any other Person for the purposes aforesaid, or either of
them; and any Person having the Care, or Management of,
or in any Manner assisting in conducting the business of
any House, Office, Room, or Place opened, kept, or used for
the Purposes aforesaid, or either of them, shall, on summary
Conviction thereof, before any Two Justices of the Peace, be
liable to forfeit and pay such Penalty, not exceeding One
Hundred Pounds, as shall be adjudged by such Justices, and
may be further adjudged by such Justices, to pay such Costs
attending such conviction, as to the said Justices shall seem
reasonable; and, on the Nonpayment of such Penalty and
Costs; or, in the first instance, if to the said Justices, it shall
seem fit, may be committed to the Common Gaol, or House
of Correction, with, or without, Hard Labour, for any Time
not exceeding Six Calendar Months.”</p>

<p>The effect of this Act was to shut up, for the time, the
betting houses, but nobody can deny that there is as much
of this ready money betting now as ever there was, and there
is no difficulty in getting “a little bit on,” if one wants to,
without attending races and betting with the professional
bookmakers there to be found. Children can lay their
pennies and errand boys their sixpences, and, throughout
the length and breadth of the country, the curse of betting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
permeates every rank, and, I am sorry to say, spares neither
sex.</p>

<p>The police do something, in occasionally obtaining convictions,
and magistrates have strained the interpretation of
the word “Place” which occurs in the Act to its very limit&mdash;indeed
it has only lately (July 1897) been settled that the
betting ring at a race course is not a “Place” within the
meaning of the Act. A bookmaker, named Dunn, was
fined £1 for betting at Kempton Park race meeting. He
appealed, and the magistrate’s decision was reversed. The
judges inquired into what was the real intention of the Legislature.
This is sufficiently apparent from the preamble,
which states that “a certain kind of gaming has, of late,
sprung up, by the opening of places called betting houses,”
and we are justified in assuming that it was this “kind of
gaming,” and no other, which Parliament intended to suppress.
Furthermore, when once this fact is appreciated, the
use of the words “house, office, room, or other place” is no
longer misleading, because “place” means something <i>ejusdem
generis</i>, a “house, office, or room.” It was impossible to
maintain that an open race course, or an open enclosure upon
a race course, is a “place” of the same kind as a “house,
office, or room,” or that the people who use it for betting
claim to hold it against all the world, as they would in the
case of their own offices.</p>

<p>As a rule, the higher class professional bookmakers are a
very respectable lot of men, and are scrupulously honest in
their dealings, which is more than can be said for some of
their clients, even titled ones. Such men as Davis, Steel,
and Fry dealt in vast sums, and no matter how hard hit,
never once failed to meet their losses; and some of them
have died rich. Gully is said to have left about a quarter of
a million behind him, Davis’s fortune at his death is variously
stated at £50,000 or £150,000, and Swindells died worth
£145,000.</p>

<p>As to these men’s clients let Sir George Chetwynd tell a
tale. “I should like Fry, Steel, Emerson, Baylis, and others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
to publish their list of bad debts during the last few years.
People would be astonished at the amount owed to these
men, yet they rather condone the fact of being owed money,
by hardly ever applying the remedy of making the loser a
defaulter, and all sorts of people are going about to race
courses, now owing the Ring money, the creditors hoping,
some day, to recover a portion of it. The most disgraceful
part of it is, that some of these defaulters are owners of race
horses, gentlemen riders, and so forth. Personally, I have
no pity for book makers who do not post a man for owing
them money, after they have given him a reasonable time
for payment. If this were done, a healthier tone would be
given to betting; there would not be so much reckless
plunging as there is, and it would be far better for backers
and layers. I recollect once, on the day the Two Thousand
was run for, some years ago, I was standing talking to Henry
Steel, for whose judgment I have a great respect, and whom
I have always found most straightforward in all his dealings.
By his side was his trusty partner, Peech. All of a sudden,
I saw the latter make hurriedly off in a bee line through the
scattered crowd that thronged the bird cage, and, on asking
Steel what was up, he laughed, and said, ‘Oh, nothing, Sir
George, it’s only Bill after a bit of old’; meaning that he
had seen a man who had owed him money for some years,
and had gone to give him a gentle reminder of the fact.”</p>

<p>My readers may not be aware of the awful punishment
that awaits defaulters, and I cannot do better than give that
knowledge in Mr Rice’s words.</p>

<p>“What unfair play and loaded dice did at night, defaulting
bettors&mdash;‘welshers,’ as they are now called&mdash;practised
by day. The best legitimate Meetings, as well as the minor
country side ventures, were infested with the rogues. They
dressed well, wore frilled shirts and ‘flash’ rings, and were,
perhaps, better able to pay their way about than honest
men. The Chichester ‘extortioners,’ with their guinea bed
for a single night’s lodging, were unable to keep these gentry
away from the Ducal meeting; and the unmerciful dealings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
of mine hosts at Doncaster, Windsor, Warwick, and Newmarket,
who enjoyed, in those days, an unenviable notoriety
for the extravagance of their charges, were, likewise, powerless
to clear their coffee rooms from the welshing community.</p>

<p>“Measures were taken to reduce the evil. To begin with,
the Messrs Tattersall issued a code of new rules and regulations,
to be observed, in future, by all subscribers to the
betting room at the Corner. A subscription of two guineas
per annum was fixed. Gentlemen desirous of subscribing
were to give a week’s notice, in writing, to Messrs Tattersall
and Son, submitting references for their approval. Non-subscribers
might be admitted on payment of a guinea;
and, the room being under the sanction of the Jockey Club,
all the members were to be obedient to any suggestions
made by the Senate of the Turf, from time to time. Lastly,
special attention was called to the forty-first rule of the
Jockey Club, which enacted that any bettor adjudged to be
a defaulter by the Stewards, should not be permitted to go
on the Heath at Newmarket, and they should be excluded
from the betting rooms there, and at Tattersall’s.</p>

<p>“This step in a right direction was followed, a few months
later, by the action of the Trustees of the Grand Stand at
Ascot, who gave notice that all defaulters in respect to
stakes, forfeits, or bets on horse racing, would be peremptorily
excluded during any Meeting on the Heath at Ascot; and,
if any one in default, did gain admission, on being pointed
out to the Noble Master of Her Majesty’s Buckhounds, or
to the Clerk of the Course, he would, if necessary, be expelled
by force, unless he were able to show that he had discharged
all his obligations.</p>

<p>“At Goodwood, a similar active policy was pursued; no
person, being notoriously a defaulter upon bets on horse
racing, would be permitted to ‘assist’ at the Meeting. A
contumelious defaulter having obtained admission to the
Enclosure, he received peremptory orders to quit; and the
example set by the Stewards of Ascot and Goodwood was
promptly taken up by the better class of country Meetings;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
and notices were posted, that if any person notoriously in
default, as to either forfeits, or bets, gained admittance, he
should be peremptorily expelled. At Doncaster, it was
requested that all parties who had claims for bets, would
not fail to notify the same to Mr Butterfield, Land Steward
to the Corporation, prior to the races, at his office, or at the
Grand Stand. Lord Eglinton, who had taken a prominent
part in the endeavour to stamp out this evil, wrote to the
Town Clerk: ‘It gives me much pleasure to find that the
Corporation of Doncaster have passed the Resolutions.
Defaulters have become so numerous, and so audacious in
their proceedings, that it is absolutely necessary that the
strongest measures should be adopted against them.’ The
Corporation of Doncaster, at their meeting, when his Lordship’s
letter was read, resolved, unanimously, that the Town
Clerk be requested, immediately, to confer with the proprietors
of the Betting Rooms, and that Lord Eglinton be
permitted to purify those rooms, as well as the Stand and
Enclosure.</p>

<p>“But to the influence and exertions of Lord George
Bentinck, the ‘legitimates’ owed the clearance of the Turf
from the hordes of welshers and other non-payers that
infested it. This ‘pleasing reform of the Turf’ was
brought about by his active measures; and it was admitted,
that had he not persevered to the utmost, even his powerful
influence would have been blighted, and the host of rotten
sheep left to infect the sound constitution of the remaining
flock. But such was the effect of the sharp remedies employed,
that, for some time after, it was safe to make a bet
with any man whom you might meet in the Betting Ring
at respectable Race Meetings, so effectually was the Turf
ridded of the pests that had infested it.”</p>

<p>Probably, the greatest defaulter of modern times was a
man named Dwyer, who kept a cigar shop in St Martin’s
Lane. He, generally, gave a point or two more than the
current odds at Tattersall’s, and, in 1851, he was doing, by
far, the largest business of any “list man” in London.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Owing to the promptitude and regularity of his payments,
he gained a high reputation for solvency, and not only
retained and increased his <i>clientèle</i> among the half-crown and
shilling public, but had attracted the custom even of men of
good standing in the ring. His humble patrons believed
him to be every whit as safe as “Leviathan” Davis, and their
confidence was largely shared by racing men of a higher
calibre.</p>

<p>All went well till the Chester Meeting of 1851, the Cup
being, then, the greatest betting handicap in the Calendar;
so much so that, in that year it was calculated that upwards
of <i>a million sterling</i> changed hands over that one race.
Dwyer laid very heavily against the winner <i>Miss Nancy</i>. It
had always been his custom to pay up on the day after a
great race; and, consequently, at an early hour on Friday,
the first of May, crowds of the lucky backers of Nancy made
their way to the familiar cigar shop in St Martin’s Lane, to
receive their winnings in exchange for the tickets they held.
Conceive their consternation when they found the shutters
up, and the door closed, with other unmistakable signs that
the bank had suspended payment. The news spread fast,
and there was soon a mob of some thousands blocking up
all the approaches to the cigar shop.</p>

<p>By and by it oozed out that a notice had been fastened
to the shutters to the effect that Mr Dwyer would meet
his friends and creditors that evening at the White Swan,
Chandos Street, in order to make arrangements for discharging
the claims against him. Of course, that hostelry
was immediately besieged by a clamorous crowd, but the
landlord assured them that he knew nothing of Dwyer or
his whereabouts&mdash;all he could tell them was that, late on
the previous evening, two gentlemen, who were perfect
strangers to him, had called and engaged his “long-room”
for a meeting of Mr Dwyer and his friends on the following
day. Meanwhile, the cigar shop had been broken into, and
the worst fears of the unfortunate victims were confirmed
when they found that every scrap of furniture that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
worth anything had been removed from the house during
the night. The excitement in London that evening was
tremendous&mdash;nothing else was talked of among sporting
men but Dwyer’s collapse, and it was afterwards found
that he had bolted with £25,000 of the public’s money.
The rogue was never found.</p>

<p>The largest sum ever won by a horse was made by
<i>Donovan</i>, who, in his lifetime, carried off stakes to the value
of £55,354, 13s.; but the largest amount of “public money”
ever won without betting by an owner in a single season
is £73,858, 10s., won by the Duke of Portland in 1889;
whilst Lord Falmouth, who did not bet, won nearly £212,000
in eleven years, from 1873 to 1883, and in 1884 he sold
his whole stud for at least £150,000. Count Lagrange
also won in stakes in five years, from 1876 to 1880,
£73,000.</p>

<p>These sums, with the exception of the Duke of Portland’s
winnings, were made before the era of enormous stakes
had begun; and, according to a writer (<i>Rapier</i>) in the
<i>Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News</i> in 1892, 2559
horses ran flat races for £486,556, which sum was won
by 947 competitors. These figures give us some insight
into the enormous interests involved in horse racing, entirely
leaving out the millions which must change hands
in betting.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="pch">The Lottery&mdash;Its etymology and origin&mdash;The first in England&mdash;Succeeding ones&mdash;Prince
Rupert’s jewels&mdash;Penny Lottery. Suppression and revival&mdash;Rage
for them in Queen Anne’s reign&mdash;Lotteries for public purposes&mdash;Leheup’s
fraud.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="beg">I have</span> written very fully on the Lottery in England,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> but,
in this History of Gambling in this country, it is necessary
to go over the ground again, though, of course, at much
less length. Some claim that the Romans introduced the
lottery, in their <i>Apophoreta</i>, but these were simply presents
given to guests at their departure after a banquet, and sometimes
they were so disposed as to create great merriment.
The fourteenth book of Martial consists of an introductory
epigram and 222 distiches, each describing and designed
to accompany one of these presents which range from nuts
to works of art and slaves.</p>

<p>So we may dismiss its Roman origin and examine into
the generally accepted (because never questioned) theory of
its Italian birth. That the Venetian and Genoese merchants
did sometimes use the <i>Lotto</i> as a means of getting rid of
their wares, is true&mdash;but the very name shows its northern
derivation, for the Latin word for a lot is <i>Sors</i>. The Anglo-Saxon
for “to cast lots” is Hleot-au. In Dutch it is Lot-en,
Loot-en, and in Swedish, Lotta. Indeed, the first
record I can find of any lottery is that of the widow of
Jan van Eyck, which took place at Bruges on 24th February
1446, the town archives recording a payment to her for
her lottery.</p>

<p>The first <i>public</i> English lottery was projected in 1566,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
but was not drawn until 1569. Only one authentic record
of this lottery is believed to be in existence, and it is carefully
preserved in the muniment room at Losely House,
Artington, Surrey.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> It is printed in black letter, and is
five feet long by nineteen inches wide, so that I can only
give the preamble to it.</p>

<p>“A verie rich Lotterie Generall, without any blancks,
contayning a number of good prices, as wel of redy money
as of plate, and certaine sorts of marchaundizes, having been
valued and priced by the comaundement of the Queene’s
most excellent majestie, by men expert and skilfull; and
the same Lotterie is erected by her majestie’s order, to the
intent that such commoditie as may chaunce to arise thereof,
after the charges borne, may be converted towardes the
reparation of the havens and strength of the Realme, and
towardes such other publique good workes. The number
of lots shall be foure hundreth thousand, and no more; and
every lot shall be the summe of tenne shillings sterling
onely, and no more.”</p>

<p>And the bill, which was printed in 1567, winds up thus:
“The shewe of the prices and rewardes above mencioned
shall be set up to be seene in Cheapsyde in London, at the
signe of the Queene’s Majesties’ Arms, in the house of
M. Dericke, goldsmith, servant to the Queene’s most excellent
Majestie.”</p>

<p>But people fought so shy of the scheme that the proclamation
had to be backed by the recommendation of the
Lord Mayor, and, this proving of no avail, the Queen issued
another on 3rd January 1586, postponing the drawing on
account of the slack subscription, and, this not succeeding,
the Earl of Leicester and Sir William Cecil, as Lords of the
Council, on July 12, 1558, sent a circular to all the
authorities in the Counties of Kent, Sussex, Surrey, Southampton,
and the Isle of Wight, begging them to do all in
their power to get subscribers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>By the terms of the lottery, the subscribers were to be
anonymous, their subscriptions being accompanied by a
“devise or poesie.” Many of these remain in a little black
letter book at Losely, and I give two or three from various
shipping places.</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“Yermouth haven, God send thee spede,<br />
The Lord he knoweth thy great nede.”</p>

<p class="ppq2 p1">“In good hope, poor East Greenwiche, God send us to remain,<br />
And of some good lotte to have the gaine.”</p>

<p class="ppq8 p1">“Draw Brightemston<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> a good lot,<br />
Or else return them a turbot.”</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“From Hastings we come,<br />
God send us good speed;<br />
Never a poor fisher town in England,<br />
Of y<sup>e</sup> great lot hath more need.”</p>

<p class="p1">At last, the Lottery was drawn, in 1569, as we learn
from Holinshed. “A great lotterie being holden at London,
in Poules Church Yard, at the west dore, was begun to be
drawne the eleventh of Januarie, and continued daie and
night till the sixt of Maie, wherein the said drawing was
fullie ended.”</p>

<p>Stow, in his <i>Annales</i>, tells us of the next Lottery, 1585:
“A lotterie for marvellous rich and beautifull armor was
begunne to be drawne at London in <i>S. Paules</i> Churchyard,
at the great West gate (an house of timber and boord being
there erected for that purpose) on <i>S. Peter’s</i><a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> day, in the
morning, which lotterie continued in drawing day and night,
for the space of two or three dayes.”</p>

<p>As far as I can learn, the next public lottery was that of
1612, and I quote once more from the <i>Annales</i>: “The
King’s maiestie in speciall favor for the present plantation
of English Colonies in <i>Virginia</i>, granted a liberall Lottery,
in which was contained five thousand pound in prizes
certayne, besides rewardes of casualtie, and began to be
drawne in a new built house at the West end of <i>Paul’s</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
the 29th of June 1612. But, of which Lottery, for want
of filling uppe the number of lots, there were then taken out
and throwne away three score thousand blanckes, without
abating of any one prize; and by the twentith of July all
was drawne and finished. This Lottery was so plainely
carryed, and honestly performed, that it gave full satisfaction
to all persons. <i>Thomas Sharpliffe</i>, a Taylor, of London, had
the chiefe prize, <i>viz.</i> foure thousand Crownes in fayre plate,
which was sent to his house in very stately manner: during
the whole tyme of the drawing of this lottery there were
alwaies present diuers worshipfull Knights and Esquiers,
accompanied by sundry graue discreet Cittizens.”</p>

<p>There were three lotteries granted for the supply of water
to the Metropolis, in 1627, 1631, and 1689, and a petition
to hold a lottery for the same purpose in 1637, but this, I
think, was not granted. There were many licences granted
for various schemes, and there was one, called the Royal
Oak lottery, for granting assistance to old Royalists, which
seems to have been a swindle. Indeed, this may be said to
have been the case with a good many of the Lotteries in
Charles II.’s time, till, when Prince Rupert died, and his
jewels were to be disposed of by lottery, the public would
not subscribe unless the King consented to see that all was
fair, as we see by the <i>London Gazette</i>, September 27&mdash;October
1, 1683:</p>

<p>“These are to give Notice, that the Jewels of his late
Highness Prince <i>Rupert</i>, have been particularly valued and
appraised by Mr <i>Isaac Legouch</i>, Mr <i>Christopher Rosse</i>, and
Mr <i>Richard Beauvoir</i>, Jewellers, the whole amounting to
Twenty Thousand Pounds, and will be sold by way of
Lottery, each Lot to be Five Pounds. The biggest Prize
will be a great Pearl Necklace valued at £8000, and none
less than £100. A printed Particular of the said Appraisement,
with their Division into Lots, will be delivered <i>gratis</i>
by Mr <i>Francis Child</i>, Goldsmith, at Temple Bar, <i>London</i>,
into whose hands, such as are willing to be Adventurers, are
desired to pay their Money, on, or about, the first day of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
<i>November</i> next. As soon as the whole sum is paid in, a
short day will be appointed (which ‘tis hoped will be before
<i>Christmas</i>) and notified in the <i>Gazette</i>, for the drawing
thereof, which will be done in his Majesty’s Presence, who
is pleased to declare, that he, himself, will see all the Prizes
put among the Blanks, and that the whole shall be managed
with all Equity and Fairness; nothing being intended but
the Sale of the said Jewels at a moderate Value.”</p>

<p>In another <i>London Gazette</i> of Nov. 22/26, 1683, we are
told how this Lottery will be drawn, and, as it is rare to
have an English sovereign mixed up in such a speculation, I
transcribe it:</p>

<p>“As soon as the Money is all come in, a day will be prefixed,
and published for the drawing thereof, as has been
formerly notified. In the morning of which day His Majesty
will be pleased, publickly, in the Banquetting House, to see
the Blanks told over, that they may not exceed their Number,
and to read the Papers (which shall be exactly the same size
as the Blanks) on which the Prizes are to be written; which,
being rolled up in his presence, His Majesty will mix amongst
the Blanks, as may, also, any of the Adventurers there
present that shall desire it. This being done, a Child,
appointed by His Majesty, or the Adventurers, shall, out
of the Mass of Lots so mixed, take out the number that
each Person adventures for, and put them into boxes (which
shall be provided for the purpose) on the covers whereof,
each Adventurer’s Name shall be written with the number
of Lots He or She adventures for; the Boxes to be filled in
succession as the Money was paid in. As soon as all the
lots are thus distributed, they shall be opened as fast as may
be, and the prizes then and there delivered to those that win
them; all which, ‘tis hoped, will be done and finished in one
day.”</p>

<p>There was a Lottery, in which the subscription was a
penny, and the Capital prize was One Thousand Pounds,
drawn on 19th Oct. 1698, at the Dorset Garden Theatre,
near Salisbury Square, Fleet Street, but when William III.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
came to the throne, it was seen that the Lottery was a very
profitable thing, and the Government took it unto itself for
its own purposes. In 1694, £1,000,000 was raised by
Lottery, and in 1697, £1,400,000&mdash;but in 1699, by 10
and 11 Will. III., c. 17, lotteries were suppressed, the preamble
to the Act stating, “That all such Lotteries, and all
other Lotteries, are common and publick nuisances, and that
all grants, patents, and licences for such Lotteries, or any
other Lotteries, are void and against Law.”</p>

<p>It must have been about this time (for in 1698-9 three
expeditions sailed from Scotland to Darien) that Ward wrote
in <i>The London Spy</i> a description of the Lottery fever in
London:</p>

<p>“The <i>Gazette</i> and <i>Post-Papers</i> lay by Neglected, and
nothing was Pur’d over in the <i>Coffee Houses</i>, but the <i>Ticket-Catalogues</i>;
No talking of the <i>Jubilee</i>, the want of Current
Trade with <i>France</i>, or the <i>Scotch</i> Settlement at <i>Darien</i>;
Nothing Buz’d about by the Purblind <i>Trumpeters</i> of <i>State
News</i>, but <i>Blank</i> and <i>Benefit</i>. <i>My Son had Five Pound in
such a Lottery, but got nothing; my Daughter</i>, says another,
<i>had but Five Shillings, and got the Twenty Pound Prize</i>.
People running up and down the Streets in Crowds and
Numbers, as if one end of the Town was on Fire, and the
other were running to help ‘em off with their Goods. One
Stream of <i>Coachmen</i>, <i>Footmen</i>, <i>Prentice Boys</i>, and <i>Servant
Wenches</i> flowing one way, with wonderful hopes of getting
an estate for three pence. <i>Knights</i>, <i>Esquires</i>, <i>Gentlemen</i> and
<i>Traders</i>, <i>Marry’d Ladies</i>, <i>Virgin Madams</i>, <i>Jilts</i>, etc.; moving
on <i>Foot</i>, in <i>Sedans</i>, <i>Chariots</i>, and <i>Coaches</i>, another way;
with a pleasing Expectancy of getting Six Hundred a
Year for a Crown.</p>

<p>“Thus were all the <i>Fools</i> in Town so busily employed in
running up and down from one <i>Lottery</i>, or another, that it
was as much as <i>London</i> could do to Conjure together such
Numbers of <i>Knaves</i> as might Cheat ‘em fast enough of their
<i>Money</i>. The Unfortunate crying out, <i>A Cheat, a Cheat, a
Confounded Cheat, nothing of Fairness in’t</i>. The Fortunate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
in opposition to the other, crying, <i>’Tis all Fair, all Fair; the
Fairest Adventure that ever was drawn</i>. And thus, every
Body, according to their Success, Expressing variously their
Sentiments; tho’ the Losers, who may be said to be in the
Wrong of it, to venture their Money, yet, were they most
Right in their Conjectures of the Project, and the Gainers,
who were in the Right of it, to hazard their Money, because
they won, were most Wrong in their opinion of the matter.
For I have much ado to forbear believing that <i>Luck in a Bag</i>
is almost as Honest as <i>Fortune in a Wheel</i>, or any other of
the like Projects. Truly, says my Friend, I confess I cannot
conceive any extraordinary Opinion of the Fairness of any
<i>Lottery</i>, for I am apt to believe that whenever such a number
of <i>Fools</i> fall into a <i>Knave’s</i> hand, he will make the most of
‘em; and I think the <i>Parliament</i> could not have given the
<i>Nation</i> greater Assurances of their especial Regard to the
Welfare of the <i>Publick</i>, than by suppressing all <i>Lotteries</i>,
which only serve to Buoy up the mistaken Multitude with
Dreams of Golden Showers, to the Expence of that little
Money, which, with hard Labour they have Earn’d; and
often to the Neglect of their Business, which doubles the
Inconveniency. The <i>Gentry</i>, indeed, might make it their
Diversion, but the <i>Common People</i> make it a great part of
their Care and Business, hoping thereby to relieve a Necessitous
Life; instead of which, they plunge themselves further
into an Ocean of Difficulties. What if one Man in Ten
Thousand gets Five Hundred Pounds, what Benefit is that
to the rest, who have struggled hard for <i>Fool</i>’s Pence to make
up that Sum, which, perhaps, falls to one who stood not in
need of <i>Fortune</i>’s Favours.”</p>

<p>But the State Lotteries began again in Queen Anne’s
reign, for an Act (8 Anne, c. 4) was passed in 1710 authorising
a loan of £1,500,000 by means of a lottery of 150,000
tickets at £10 each. The money was to be sunk, and 9 per
cent. was allowed on it for 32 years, and the prizes were
annuities from one of £1000 to 14s. a year, which latter was
given as a consolation to every holder of a blank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>Luttrell tells us how greedily they were taken up. “21st
Jan. 1710. Yesterday, books were opened at Mercer’s
Chapel for receiving subscriptions for the Lottery, and ‘tis
said, above a Million is already subscribed; so that, ‘tis believed,
‘twill be full by Monday 7 night.” And he also tells
us that “Mr Barnaby, who lately belonged to the 6 Clerk’s
Office, has got the £1000 per ann. ticket in the lottery.”
This lottery was drawn by blue coat boys from Christ’s
Hospital, and from this time, until 1824 (except from 1814
to 1819), there was no year without a State Lottery.</p>

<p>There were Lotteries for everything, and to show how
numerous they were take the advertisements in one paper,
taken hap-hazard. <i>The Tatler</i>, Sep. 14/16, 1710: “Mr
Stockton’s Sale of Jewels, Plate, &amp;c., will be drawn on
Michaelmas Day.&mdash;The Lottery in Colson’s Court will be
drawn on the 21st inst.&mdash;The Sale of Goods to be seen at
Mrs Butler’s, &amp;c., will certainly be drawn on Tuesday, the
19th inst.&mdash;Mrs Povy’s Sale of Goods is put off to Saturday,
23rd inst.&mdash;Mrs Symond’s Sale of Goods will begin on
Wednesday, the 20th of this instant.&mdash;Mrs Guthridge’s Sixpenny
Sale of Goods, &amp;c., continues to be drawn every Day.”</p>

<p>The prizes did not always fall to those who needed the
money, as Swift writes to Stella about a son of Lord Abercorn.
Aug. 29, 1711: “His second son has t’other day got
a prize in the Lottery of Four Thousand Pounds, besides
two small ones of two hundred pounds each; nay, the family
was so fortunate, that my Lord bestowing one ticket, which
is a hundred pounds, to one of his servants, who had been
his page, the young fellow got a prize, which has made it
another hundred.”</p>

<p>In 1721 private Lotteries were prescribed, by the 36th
sec. of 8 Geo. I., c. 2, which imposed a penalty of £500 for
carrying on such lotteries, in addition to any penalties inflicted
by any former Acts; the offender being committed to prison
for one year, and thenceforward until such times as the £500
should be fully paid and satisfied.</p>

<p>The first Westminster bridge was partially built through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
the instrumentality of a lottery, the drawing of which began
on Dec. 8, 1740, at Stationers’ Hall; and by an Act of
Parliament (26 Geo. II., c. 22) passed in 1753, the nation
purchased for £20,000, the library and collection of Sir
Hans Sloane, and incorporated Sir Robert Cotton’s library
with it. Montague House was selected for their reception,
and a lottery to provide for its purchase was got up; the
subscription to which was £300,000 in tickets of £3 each.
The Managers and Trustees of this Lottery were The Archbishop
of Canterbury, the Lord Chancellor, and the Speaker,
each of whom was to have £100 for his trouble.</p>

<p>In connection with this lottery was a gross fraud, and on
19th April 1755, Peter Leheup, one of the receivers of the
Lottery was tried at the King’s bench and found guilty, 1st,
of receiving subscriptions before the day and hour advertised;
2nd, of permitting subscribers to use different names to
cover the maximum of 20 tickets allowed to each holder;
and 3rd, of disposing of the tickets which had been bespoke
and not claimed, or were double-charged, instead of returning
them to the managers. For these <i>laches</i> he was, on the
following 9th of May, fined £1000, which he immediately
paid into Court.</p>

<p>In a lottery of 1767 a lady residing in Holborn was presented
with a ticket by her husband, and so anxious was she
for its success, that on the Sunday previous to the drawing,
the clergyman gave out that “the prayers of the congregation
are desired for the success of a person engaged in a
new undertaking.”</p>

Lotteries&mdash;Lever Museum and Pigot diamond lotteries&mdash;Little goes&mdash;Stories
of winning numbers&mdash;Decline of Lotteries&mdash;The last&mdash;Its epitaph&mdash;Modern
lotteries.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="beg">Twice</span> in the year 1775 were the blue coat boys, who drew
the tickets from the lottery wheels, tampered with; and the
following accounts are taken from the <i>Annual Register</i> of
that year:</p>

<p>“1 June. A man was carried before the Lord Mayor, for
attempting to bribe the two Blue Coat boys, who drew the
Museum<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> lottery, to conceal a ticket, and bring it to him,
promising he would, next day, let them have it again, when
one of them was, it seems, to convey it back privately to the
wheel, but without letting go his hold of it, and then produce
it as if newly drawn; the man’s intention being to
insure it in all the offices against being drawn that day.
But the boys were honest, gave notice of the intended
fraud, and pointed out the delinquent, who, however, was
discharged, as there is no law in being, to punish the
offence.”</p>

<p>“5 Dec. By virtue of a warrant from Sir Charles Asgill,
was brought before the magistrate, at Guildhall, the clerk of
an eminent hop factor in Goodman’s Fields, upon suspicion
of being concerned with a person, not yet apprehended, in
defrauding a lottery office keeper, near the ‘Change, of a
large sum of money. This matter being undertaken by the
Commissioners of the Lottery, the Solicitor of the Treasury
appeared against the prisoner, and for him attended, as
Counsel, Mr Cox.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>“The first witness examined was the lottery office keeper,
he said, that about a fortnight ago, the prisoner insured No.
21,481 six times over for the subsequent day of drawing;
that the conversation he had with the prisoner at that time,
and the seeming positiveness there appeared in the latter,
that the ticket would come up, caused him to enquire at
other lottery offices, when he found the same number insured,
in the prisoner’s name, at all the principal offices
about the ‘Change; that the ticket was drawn the first hour
of drawing the subsequent day. This, with his former suspicion,
alarmed him, and he immediately went to Christ’s
Hospital, and saw the boy who drew the ticket; that he
interrogated him, whether he had clandestinely taken that
number out of the wheel, or whether he had been solicited
to do so, which the boy positively denied; that, observing
that he answered rather faintly, he importuned him to
divulge the truth, which, after some hesitation, produced
an acknowledgment of the fact.</p>

<p>“The next witness was the Blue Coat boy. He said that,
about three weeks ago, the person who is not in custody, and
whom he had known before he went to the Hospital, took
him to a Coffee House, where they breakfasted together;
that he wanted to know of the witness, whether it was possible
to get a ticket out of the wheel; to which the latter
answered, No. That being, afterwards, solicited for the same
purpose, by him, to secrete a ticket, he, at length, promised
to do so; that, accordingly, he took two at one time out of
the wheel, gave one to the person who called it over, and
put the other in his pocket; that the person who induced
him to do it was then in the gallery, and nodded his head to
the witness to signify when was a proper time; that, after
the witness came out of the hall, he gave the ticket to the
person who sat in the gallery, and who was then waiting for
the witness in the Guildhall Yard; that the next time the
witness drew the lottery, the person before mentioned returned
him the ticket, which the witness put in the wheel,
and drew out the same day; that he did this three several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
times, and received from the person for whom he did it,
several half guineas; that he has heard the prisoner’s name
mentioned by him, but never heard the latter acknowledge
any connection between them in insurance; and, never before,
saw the prisoner.</p>

<p>“The prisoner acknowledged he insured the ticket 79
times for one day. The mother of the person who was
not apprehended, was next examined; she proved an acquaintance
between her son and the prisoner; but denied
any remembrance of ever hearing the latter mention anything
relating to insurance. The prisoner was discharged.</p>

<p>“It is said that the person who absconded, got about
£400 by the above fraud; and would have got £3000, had
he been paid in all the offices where he insured.”</p>

<p>But, that such a fraud should not be perpetrated again, the
Lords of the Treasury, on 12th Dec. 1775, issued an Order,
of which the following is an extract:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">It is therefore ordered</span>, for preventing the like
wicked practices in future, that every boy, before he is
suffered to put his hand into either wheel, be brought by the
proclaimer to the managers on duty, for them to see <i>that the
bosoms and sleeves of his coat be closely buttoned, his pockets
sewed up, and his hands examined</i>; and that, during the time
of his being on duty, <i>he shall keep his left hand in his girdle
behind him, and his right hand open, with his fingers extended</i>:
and the proclaimer is not to suffer him, at any time, to leave
the wheel, without, first, being examined by the Manager
nearest him.”</p>

<p>They also “requested of the Treasurer of Christ’s Hospital,
not to make known who are the twelve boys nominated for
drawing the lottery, till the morning before the drawing
begins; which said boys are all to attend every day, and
the two who are to go on duty at the wheels, are to be
taken promiscuously from amongst the whole number, by
either of the secretaries, without observing any regular course,
or order; so that no boy shall know when it will be his
turn to go to either wheel.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p><i>À propos</i> of insuring lottery tickets, Horace Walpole
writes to the Countess of Ossory, 17th Dec. 1780: “As folks
in the country love to hear of <i>London fashions</i>, know,
Madam, that the reigning one amongst the <i>quality</i>, is to
go, after the opera, to the lottery offices, where their Ladyships
bet with the keepers. You choose any number you
please; if it does not come up next day, you pay five
guineas; if it does, receive forty, or in proportion to the age
of the <i>tirage</i>. The Duchess of Devonshire, in one day, won
nine hundred pounds. General Smith, as the luckiest of all
mites, is of the most select parties, and chooses the numeros.”</p>

<p>On Jan. 6, 1777, two Jews were brought before the Lord
Mayor, charged with counterfeiting a lottery ticket; but, as
they brought plenty of false witnesses, they were acquitted.
But one, Daniel Denny, was not so lucky on Feb. 24, the
same year, for he was convicted of the same crime. The
<i>Annual Register</i> for this year says:</p>

<p>“The following is a true state of the different methods of
getting money by lottery office keepers, and other ingenious
persons, who have struck out different plans of getting
money by the State Lottery of 1777.</p>

<p>“First, His Majesty’s Royal Letters Patent for securing
the Property of the purchasers.</p>

<p>“Secondly, A few office keepers who advertise ‘By
authority of Parliament’ to secure your property in shares
and chances.</p>

<p>“Thirdly, Several schemes for shares and chances, only
entitling the purchasers to all prizes above twenty pounds.</p>

<p>“Fourthly, A bait for those who can only afford to
venture a shilling.</p>

<p>“Then come the ingenious sett of lottery merchants, viz.
Lottery magazine proprietors&mdash;Lottery tailors&mdash;Lottery stay
makers&mdash;Lottery glovers&mdash;Lottery hat makers&mdash;Lottery tea
merchants&mdash;Lottery snuff and tobacco merchants&mdash;Lottery
handkerchiefs&mdash;Lottery bakers&mdash;Lottery barbers (where a
man, for being shaved, and paying threepence, may stand a
chance of getting ten pounds)&mdash;Lottery shoe blacks&mdash;Lottery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
eating houses; one in Wych Street, Temple-bar,
where, if you call for six penny worth of roast, or boiled
beef, you receive a note of hand, with a number, which,
should it turn out fortunate, may entitle the eater of the
beef to sixty guineas&mdash;Lottery oyster stalls, by which the
fortunate may get five guineas for three penny worth of
oysters. And, to complete this curious catalogue, an old
woman, who keeps a sausage stall in one of the little alleys
leading to Smithfield, wrote up, in chalk, <i>Lottery sausages</i>,
or, five shillings to be gained for a farthing relish.”</p>

<p>In 1782 an Act was passed, whereby lottery office
keepers were to pay a licence of £50, under a penalty of
£100 if they did not do so.</p>

<p>Sir Ashton Lever disposed of his Museum by lottery in
1758 by Act of Parliament, and another Act was procured
to dispose of, by lottery, a large diamond, the property of
the deceased Lord Pigot, valued at £30,000. This lottery
was drawn on Jan. 2, 1801, and the winner of the prize was
a young man, name unknown. It was, afterwards, sold at
Christie’s on May 10, 1802, for 9500 guineas. It was
again sold, and is said to have passed into the possession of
Messrs Rundell and Bridge, the Court jewellers, who are
reported to have sold it to an Egyptian Pasha for £30,000.</p>

<p>But, in the latter part of the eighteenth century, a system
of private lotteries, called “little goes” had sprung up, and
they are thus described in the <i>Times</i> of 22nd July 1795:</p>

<p>“Amongst the various species of Gaming that have ever
been practised, we think none exceeds the mischiefs, and
calamities that arise from the practice of private lotteries,
which, at present, are carrying on, in various parts of the
town, to very alarming extents, much to the discredit of
those whose province it is to suppress such nefarious practices,
as they cannot be ignorant of such transactions. ‘The
little go,’ which is the technical term for a private lottery, is
calculated only for the meridian of those understandings,
who are unused to calculate and discriminate between right
and wrong, and roguery and fair dealing; and, in this particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
case, it is those who compose the lower order of
society, whom it so seriously affects, and, on whom, it is
chiefly designed to operate. No man of common sense can
suppose that the lottery wheels are fair and honest, or that
the proprietors act upon principles anything like honour, or
honesty; for, by the art, and contrivance, of the wheels, they
are so constructed, with secret springs, and the application
of gum, glue, &amp;c., in the internal part of them, that they can
draw the numbers out, or keep them in, at pleasure, just
as it suits their purposes; so that the ensurer, robbed and
cajoled, by such unfair means, has not the most distant
chance of ever winning; the whole being a gross fraud, and
imposition, in the extreme. We understand the most
notorious of these standards of imposition, are situated in
Carnaby Market, Oxford Road, in the Borough, Islington,
Clerkenwell, and various other places, most of which are
under the very nose of Magistracy, in seeming security,
bidding defiance to law, and preying upon the vitals of the
poor and ignorant.</p>

<p>“We hope the Magistrates of each jurisdiction, and those
who possess the same power, will perform their duty on
behalf of the poor, over whom they preside, and put a stop
to such a growing, and alarming evil, of such pernicious
and dangerous tendency; particularly as the proprietors
are well-known bad characters, consisting of needy beggars,
desperate swindlers, gamblers, sharpers, notorious thieves,
and common convicted felons; most of whose names stand
recorded in the Newgate Calendar for various offences of
different descriptions.”</p>

<p><i>11th Aug. 1795.</i> “On Friday night last, in consequence
of searching warrants from the parochial magistrates of St
James’s Westminster, upwards of 30 persons were apprehended
at the house of one M’Call, No. 2 Francis Street, near
Golden Square, and in the house of J. Knight, King Street,
where the most destructive practices <i>to the poor</i> were carrying
on, that of <i>Private Lotteries</i> (called Little Goes). Two
wheels, with the tickets, were seized on the premises.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
Upon examination of those persons, who proved to be the
poor deluded objects who had been there plundered, they
were reprimanded, and discharged.</p>

<p>“The wives of many industrious mechanics, by attending
these nefarious houses, have not only been duped out of
their earnings (which ought to have been applied to the
providing bread for their families), but have even pawned
their beds, wedding rings, and almost every article they
were possessed of, for that purpose.”</p>

<p>Here are two anecdotes of the winners of the great prize,
which was, usually, £20,000, from the <i>Times</i>:</p>

<p><i>27th Dec. 1797.</i> “Dr B., a physician at <i>Lime</i> (Dorset), a
few days since, being under pecuniary embarrassment, and
his house surrounded by bailiffs, made his escape by a
window, into a neighbour’s house, from whence he fled to
London. The furniture was seized, and the sale actually
commenced, when it was stopped by a letter, stating that
the Doctor, upon his arrival in London, found himself the
proprietor of the £20,000 prize. We guarantee the truth
of this fact.”</p>

<p><i>19th Mar. 1798.</i> “The £20,000 prize, drawn on Friday,
is divided amongst a number of poor persons: a female
servant in Brook Street, Holborn, had a sixteenth; a woman
who keeps a fruit stall in Gray’s Inn Lane, another; a
third is possessed by a servant of the Duke of Roxburghe;
a fourth by a Chelsea carrier of vegetables to Covent
Garden; one-eighth belongs to a poor family in Rutlandshire,
and the remainder is similarly divided.”</p>

<p>In 1802, old Baron d’Aguilar, the Islington miser, was
requested, by a relation, to purchase a particular ticket,
No. 14,068; but it had been sold some few days previously.
The baron died on the 16th of March following, and the
number was the first drawn ticket on the 24th, and, as such,
entitled to £20,000. The baron’s representatives, under
these circumstance, published an advertisement, offering a
reward of £1000 to any person who might have found the
said ticket, and would deliver it up. Payment was stopped.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
A wholesale linen draper in Cornhill (who had ordered his
broker to buy him ten tickets, which he deposited in a
chest), on copying the numbers for the purpose of examining
them, made a mistake in one figure, and called it
14,168 instead of 14,068, which was the £20,000 prize.
The lottery being finished, he sent his tickets to be examined
and marked. To his utter astonishment, he then
found the error in the number copied on his paper. On his
demanding payment at the lottery office, a <i>caveat</i> was
entered by old d’Aguilar’s executors; but, an explanation
taking place, the £20,000 was paid to the lucky linen
draper.</p>

<p>Although these lotteries were a great source of revenue to
Government, and, consequently, relieved the taxpayer to the
amount of their profit, it began to dawn upon the public
that this legalised gambling was somewhat immoral; and,
in 1808, a Committee of the House of Commons was appointed,
to inquire how far the evil attending lotteries had
been remedied by the laws passed respecting the same; and,
in their Report, they said that “the foundation of the lottery
system is so radically vicious, that your Committee feel convinced
that under no system of regulations, which can be
devised, will it be possible for Parliament to adopt it as an
efficacious source of revenue, and, at the same time, divest it
of all the evils which it has, hitherto, proved so baneful a
source.”</p>

<p>Yet they continued to be held; but, when the Lottery Act
of 1818 was passing through the House of Commons, Mr
Parnell protested against it, and, in the course of his speech,
suggested that the following epitaph should be inscribed on
the tomb of the Chancellor of the Exchequer: “Here lies
the Right Hon. Nicholas Vansittart, once Chancellor of the
Exchequer; the patron of Bible Societies, the builder of
Churches, a friend to the education of the poor, an encourager
of Savings’ banks, and&mdash;a supporter of Lotteries!”</p>

<p>And, in 1819, when the lottery for that year was being
discussed, Mr Lyttleton moved:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>1. That by the establishment of State lotteries, a spirit of
gambling, injurious, in the highest degree, to the morals of
the people, is encouraged and provoked.</p>

<p>2. That such a habit, manifestly weakening the habits of
industry, must diminish the permanent sources of the public
revenue.</p>

<p>3. That the said lotteries have given rise to other systems
of gambling, which have been but partially repressed by
laws, whose provisions are extremely arbitrary, and their
enforcement liable to the greatest abuse.</p>

<p>4. That this House, therefore, will no longer authorise
the establishment of State lotteries under any system of
regulations whatever.</p>

<p>Needless to say, these resolutions were not passed, but
the Lottery was on its last legs, for, in the Lottery Act of
1823, provision was made for its discontinuance after the
drawing of the lottery sanctioned in that Act. Yet this was
not adhered to, and a “last lottery” was decreed to be drawn
in 1826. Its date was originally fixed for the 18th of July,
but the public did not subscribe readily, and it was postponed
until the 18th of October, and, on that day it was
drawn at Cooper’s Hall, Basinghall Street. Here is an
epitaph which was written on it:</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">In Memory of<br />
<span class="smcap">The State of Lottery</span>,<br />

It continued to linger out the few<br />
remaining<br />

or sympathy, and finally terminated<br />
its career unregretted by any<br />

<p class="p1">In 1836 an Act was passed “to prevent the advertising
of Foreign and illegal lotteries,” but circulars still come
from Hamburg and other places. In 1844 an Act was
passed “to indemnify persons connected with Art Unions,
and others, against certain penalties.” Still there were minor
lotteries and raffles, and the law was seldom set in force
against them, any more than it is now when applied to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
charitable purposes; yet in 1860 one Louis Dethier, was
haled up at Bow Street for holding a lottery for £10,000
worth of Twelfth Cakes, and was only let off on consenting
to stop it at once, and nowadays the lottery is practically
dead, except when some petty rogue is taken up for deluding
children with prize sweets.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="beg">We</span> are apt to think that company promoters and
commercial speculation are things of modern growth,
but <i>Projectors</i> and <i>Patentees</i> (company promoters and
monopolists) were common in the early seventeenth
century; and we find an excellent exposition of their
ways and commodities in a poetical broadside by John
Taylor, the Water poet, published in 1641. It is entitled
<i>The complaint of M. Tenter-hooke the</i> Proiector, <i>and Sir
Thomas Dodger, the</i> Patentee. Under the title is a wood-cut,
which represents a <i>Projector</i>, who has a pig’s head
and ass’s ears, screws for legs, and fish hooks for fingers,
bears a measure of coal, and a barrel of wine, on his legs
respectively, tobacco, pipes, dice, roll tobacco, playing cards,
and a bundle of hay slung to his body, papers of pins on
his right arm, and a measure for spirits on his left arm, a
barrel and a dredger on the skirts of his coat. With his
fish hook fingers, he drags bags of money. This is Tenter-hooke,
who is saying to his friend Sir Thomas Dodger, who
is represented as a very well dressed gentleman of the
period:</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“I have brought money to fill your chest,<br />
For which I am curst by most and least.”</p>

<p class="pn1">To which Sir Thomas replies:</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“Our many yeares scraping is lost at a clap,<br />

The <i>Bug-beare</i> and the <i>Scarcrow</i> of this Nation,<br />
Th’ admired mighty <i>Mounte-banke</i> of <i>Fame</i>,<br />
The Juggling <i>Hocus Pocus</i> of good name;<br />
The <i>Bull-begger</i> who did affright and feare,<br />
And rake, and pull, teare, pill, pole, shave and sheare,<br />
Now <i>Time</i> hath pluck’d the <i>Vizard</i> from my face,<br />

My ugly shape I hid so cunningly,<br />

I was a man esteem’d of ex’lent worth.<br />
And (Sweet Sir <i>Thomas Dodger</i>,) for your sake,<br />
My studious time I spent, my sleepes I brake;<br />
My braines I tost with many a strange vagary.<br />
And, (like a Spaniell) did both fetch and carry<br />
To you, such <i>Projects</i>, as I could invent,<br />
Not thinking there would come a Parliament.<br />
I was the great <i>Projector</i>, and from me,<br />
Your Worship learn’d to be a <i>Patentee</i>;<br />
I had the Art to cheat the Common-weale,<br />

What was I but your Journey man, I pray,<br />
To bring youre worke to you, both night and day:<br />
I found <i>Stuffe</i>, and you brought it so about,<br />
You (like a skilfull <i>Taylor</i>) cut it out,<br />
And fashion’d it, but now (to our displeasure)<br />
You fail’d exceedingly in taking measure.<br />
My legs were Screws, to raise thee high or low,<br />
According as your power did <i>Ebbe</i> or <i>Flow</i>;<br />
And at your will I was Screw’d up too high,<br />
That tott’ring, I have broke my necke thereby.<br />
For you, I made my <i>Fingers fish-hookes</i> still<br />
To catch at all <i>Trades</i>, either good, or ill,<br />
I car’d not much who lost, so we might get,<br />

<p class="p1">The first loans to Government, in a regular form, took the
form of Tontines, so called from their inventor Lorenzo
Tonti. A Tontine is a loan raised on life annuities. A
number of persons subscribe the loan, and, in return, the
Government pay an annuity to every subscriber. At the
death of any annuitant, his annuity was divided among the
others, until the sole survivor enjoyed the whole income, and
at his death, the annuity lapsed. As an example, a Mr
Jennings, who died in 1798, aged 103&mdash;leaving behind him
a fortune of over two millions&mdash;was an original subscriber
for £100 in a Tontine: he was the last survivor, and his
income derived for his £100 was £3000 per annum. Our
National Debt began in 1689&mdash;by that, I mean that debt
that has never been repaid, and dealings in which, virtually
founded Stockbroking as a business. The Bank of England
started business on 1st Jan. 1695, and, from that time, we
may date the methodical dealing in Stocks and Shares. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
course there were intermediaries between buyer and seller,
and these were termed “Stock brokers.” They first of all
did business at the Exchange, but as they increased in number
their presence there was not desirable, and they migrated
to ‘Change Alley, close by. These gentry are described in
a little book, published in 1703, called, <i>Mirth and Wisdom
in a miscellany of different characters</i>.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">“<i>A Stock Jobber</i></p>

<p class="p1">“Is a Rational Animal, with a sensitive Understanding.
He rises and falls like the ebbing and flowing of the Sea;
and his paths are as unsearchable as hers are. He is one
of <i>Pharaoh’s</i> lean kine in the midst of plenty; and, to dream
of him is, almost, an Indication of approaching Famine.
He is ten times more changeable than the Weather; and
the living Insect from which the Grasshopper on the Royal
Bourse was drawn, never leap’d from one Place to another,
as he from one Number to another; sometimes a Hundred
and a half is too little for him; sometimes Half a hundred
is too much; and he falls seven times a Day, but not like
<i>David</i>, on his knees, to beg pardon for former Sins, but to
be made capable of sinning again. He came in with the
<i>Dutch</i>, and he had freed us from as great a Plague as they
were, had he been so kind as to have went out with them.
He lives on the Exchange, but his Dwelling cannot be said
to be the Place of his <i>Abode</i>, for he <i>abides</i> no where, he is so
unconstant and uncertain. Ask him what Religion he professes,
he cries, <i>He’ll sell you as cheap as any Body</i>; and
what Value such an Article of Faith is of, his Answer is,
<i>I’ll give you as much for a Debenture, as the best Chapman
thereabout shall</i>. He is fam’d for Injustice, yet he is a
Master of <i>Equity</i> in one particular to perfection, for he
cheats every Body alike, and is <i>Equal</i> in all his Undertakings.
The Den from which this Beast of Prey bolts out is
<i>Jonathan’s</i> Coffee House, or <i>Garraway’s</i>; and a Man that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
goes into either, ought to be as circumspect as if in an
Enemy’s country. A Dish of tea there, may be as dear to
him as a good Purchase, and a Man that is over reach’d in
either, tho’ no Drunkard, may be said to have drank away
his Estate. He may be call’d a true Unbeliever, and out of
the Pale of the Church, for he has no Faith. Is a meer
<i>Tolandist</i> in secular Concerns, at the very minute that he is
ready to take up any Goods upon Trust that shall belong
to his Neighbour. <i>St Paul’s</i> Cathedral would be a Mansion-House
fit for a Deity indeed, in his Opinion, did but the
Merchants meet there; and he can give you no subtantialler
a Reason for liking <i>Salter’s Hall</i> better than the Church,
than because of its being a House of Traffick and Commerce,
and the Sale being often held there. He is the Child of
God in one Sense only, and that is by reason of his bearing
His Image, but the Devil in many, for he fights under his
Standard. To make an end of a Subject that is endless;
he has the Figure of a Man, but the Nature of a Beast; and
either triumphs over his Fellow Adventurers, as he eats the
Bread of other People’s Carefulness, and drinks the Tears of
Orphans or Widows, or being made himself Food for others,
grows, at last, constant to one place, which is the <i>Compter</i>,
and the fittest House for such an unaccountable Fellow to
make up his Accounts in.”</p>

<p>Jonathan’s was, especially, the Coffee House which stock
jobbers frequented. Addison, in the first number of the
<i>Spectator</i>, says, “I sometimes pass for a Jew in the assembly
of Stock Jobbers at Jonathan’s”; and Mrs Centlivre has laid
one of the scenes in her <i>Bold Stroke for a Wife</i>, at Jonathan’s:
where, also, was subscribed the first foreign loan, in
1706.</p>

<p>There was a Stock Exchange hoax in the reign of Queen
Anne. A man appeared, galloping from Kensington to the
City, ordering the turnpikes to be thrown open for him, and
shouting loudly that he bore the news of the Queen’s death.
This sad message flew far and wide, and dire was its effects
in the City. The funds fell at once, but Manasseh Lopez<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
and the Jews bought all they could, and reaped the benefit
when the fraud was discovered. In 1715, too, a false report
that the Pretender had been taken, sent the Funds bounding
up, to the great profit of those who were in the secret of the
hoax.</p>

<p>About this time the demon of gambling was rampant,
every one wanted to find a short road to wealth; naturally,
there were plenty of rogues to ease them of their money,
but the most colossal stroke of gambling was the South Sea
Bubble, the only parallel to which, in modern times, is the
Railway Mania, in 1846.</p>

<p>The South Sea Company was started in 1711, to have
the monopoly of trade to the South Seas, or South Coast of
America, a region which was, even then, believed to be an
<i>El Dorado</i>. As a trading company it was not successful,
but, having a large capital, it dealt with finance. On 22nd
Jan. 1720, a proposal was laid before Parliament that the
Company should take upon themselves the National Debt,
of £30,981,712, 6s. 6-1/2d. at 5 per cent. per annum, secured
until 1727, when the whole was to be redeemable, if Parliament
so chose, and the interest to be reduced to 4 per cent.,
and “That for the liberty of increasing their Capital Stock,
as aforesaid, the Company will give, and pay into his
Majesty’s Exchequer, for the purpose of the Public, and to
be applied for paying off the public debt provided for by
Parliament, before Christmas, 1716, the sum of three
millions and a half, by four equal quarterly payments,
whereof the first payment to be at Lady Day 1721.” On
April 7, the South Sea Company’s Bill received the Royal
Assent, the £100 shares being then about £300.</p>

<p>On April 12, the directors opened their books for a
subscription of a Million, at the rate of £300 for every
£100 Capital, which was immediately taken up, twice over.
It was to be repaid in five instalments of £60. Up went
the shares with a bound; yet, to raise them still higher, the
Midsummer dividend was to be declared at 10 per cent., and
all subscriptions were to be entitled to the same. This plan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
answered so well, that another million was at once raised at
400 per cent.; and, in a few hours, a million and a half was
subscribed at that rate. The Stock went up higher and
higher, until, on the 2nd of June, it reached £890. Then,
so many wanted to sell, that, on the same afternoon, it
dropped to £640. The Company set their Agents to
work, and, when evening came, the Stock had been driven
up to £750, at about which price it continued until the
bank closed on the 22nd June.</p>

<p>Very soon, a third Subscription was started, at the rate of
£1000 for every £100, to be paid in ten equal payments,
one in hand, the other nine, quarterly. The lists were so
full that the directors enlarged it to four millions Stock,
which, at that price amounted to £40,000,000. These last
subscriptions were, before the end of June, sold at about
£2000 premium; and, after the closing of the transfer
books, the original Stock rose to over £1000 per cent. At
the same time, the first subscriptions were at 560, and the
second at 610 per cent. advance.</p>

<p>This set every one crazy, and innumerable “bubble,” or
cheating, companies were floated, or attempts made thereat.
Speculation became so rampant that, on June 11, the King
published a Proclamation declaring that all these unlawful
projects should be deemed as common nuisances, and prosecuted
as such, with the penalty of £500 for any broker
buying or selling any shares in them. Among these
companies was one “for carrying on an undertaking of
great advantage, but nobody to know what it is.” Another
was “for a wheel for perpetual motion, one million”;
and another “for the transmutation of quick silver into
a malleable fine metal.” Society was, for a brief time,
uprooted.</p>

<p>The apogee of the Company had been reached: from this
time its downfall was rapid. The Stock fell, and fell. The
aid of the Bank of England was invoked, but it came too
late; goldsmiths and brokers began to abscond. On
December 12, the House of Commons ordered that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
Directors of the South Sea Company should, forthwith,
lay before the House an account of all their proceedings;
and, on Jan. 4, 1721, a Secret Committee of the House was
ordered to report upon the Company. Then Knight, the
cashier of the Company, absconded; and a reward of £2000
was offered for his apprehension. On Feb. 15, the Parliamentary
Committee made their first report&mdash;and a pretty
one it was&mdash;bribery all over the place, and especially among
the members of the Government. The bubble was pricked
and thousands were ruined. Certainly, the fortunes of those
directors, who had any, were seized for the benefit of the
swindled, and only a small percentage of their wealth was
allowed them for their subsistence. Finally, it was settled
that the £7,000,000 which the Company stood pledged to
pay over to the Government, should be remitted, and every
Shareholder should receive £33, 6s. 8d. on £100 Stock: all
else being irretrievably lost. Over the misery entailed on the
avaricious public who were gulled, it is best to draw a veil,
and use the episode as a warning.</p>

<p>Swift wrote a poem 60 verses long, on <i>The South Sea
Project</i>, 1721, from which I extract the following:</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“There is a gulf, where thousands fell,</p>
<p class="ppn8">Here all the bold adventurers came,</p>
<p class="ppn6">A narrow sound, though deep as Hell,&mdash;</p>
<p class="ppn8"><i>’Change Alley</i> is the dreadful name.</p>

<p class="ppn6 p1">Nine times a day it ebbs and flows,</p>
<p class="ppn8">Yet he that on the surface lies,</p>
<p class="ppn6">Without a pilot, seldom knows</p>
<p class="ppn8">The time it falls, or when ‘twill rise.</p>

<p class="ppn6 p1">Subscribers, here, by thousands float,</p>
<p class="ppn8">And jostle one another down;</p>
<p class="ppn6">Each paddling in his leaky boat,</p>

<p class="pch">First mention of the Stock Exchange&mdash;Attempt at hoax&mdash;Daniel’s fraud&mdash;Berenger’s
fraud&mdash;Bubbles of 1825&mdash;The Railway Mania&mdash;30th Nov. 1845
at the Board of Trade&mdash;The fever at its height&mdash;The Marquis of Clanricarde
pricks the bubble.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="beg">In</span> 1734 an Act was passed (7 Geo. II., c. 8) entitled
“An Act to prevent the infamous practice of Stock
jobbing,” which provided that no loss in bargains for
time should be recoverable in the Courts, and placed
such speculations outside the Law altogether. It was a
dead letter, but was in force till 1860, when it was repealed.</p>

<p>The first mention of the Stock Exchange as such, is in
the <i>Daily Advertiser</i> of Thursday, July 15, 1773. “On
Tuesday, the Brokers and others at New Jonathan’s came
to a Resolution that, instead of its being called New
Jonathan’s, it is to be named the Stock Exchange, which
is to be painted over the door.” And here they abode
until, in 1801, the Stockbrokers laid the first stone of
a building of their own: having purchased Mendoza’s
boxing room, the Debating Forum of Capel Court, and
buildings contiguous to that site.</p>

<p>On May 5, 1803, an attempt was made to hoax the
Stock Exchange, which was partially successful. On that
day, at half-past eight in the morning, a man, booted and
spurred, and having every appearance of having come off a
long journey, rushed up to the Mansion House, and inquired
for the Lord Mayor, saying he was a messenger from the
Foreign Office, and had a letter for his lordship. When he
was told he was not within, he said he would leave the letter,
and begged the servant to place it where the Lord Mayor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
should get it the moment of his return; which duly happened.
The letter ran thus:</p>

<p class="pr4 p1">“Downing Street, 8 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span></p>

<p>“To the Right Hon. the Lord Mayor,&mdash;</p>

<p class="pind8">“Lord Hawkesbury presents his compliments
to the Lord Mayor, and is happy to inform him that the
negotiations between this country and the French Republic
have been amicably adjusted.”</p>

<p class="p1">Thinking it genuine, the Lord Mayor published it, and
wrote to Lord Hawkesbury, congratulating him; but the
forgery was soon exposed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Consols opened at 69, and, before noon, were
over 70, only to fall, when the truth came out, to 63. Of
course, all transactions, that day, were made null and void.
Although £500 reward was offered, nothing was ever heard
of the perpetrators of this swindle.</p>

<p>Under date of Aug. 20, 1806, the <i>Annual Register</i> says:
“A most atrocious fraud was committed on a number of
gentlemen at the Stock Exchange, it being the settling day,
by a foreign Jew, of the name of Joseph Elkin Daniels, who
has, for a long time, been a conspicuous character in the
Alley. Finding that, in consequence of the great fluctuation
of Omnium, he was not able to pay for all he had purchased
at an advanced price, he hit upon a scheme to pocket an
enormous sum of money, and with which he has decamped;
£31,000 Omnium was tendered to him in the course of
Thursday; in payment for which he gave drafts on his
bankers, amounting to £16,816, 5s., which were paid into
the respective bankers of those who had received them, to
clear in the afternoon. Having gained possession of the
Omnium, he sold it through the medium of a respectable
broker, received drafts for it, which he cleared immediately,
and set off with the produce. On his drafts being presented,
payment was refused, he having no effects at his bankers.”</p>

<p>A hue and cry was raised after him, and he was soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
discovered in the Isle of Man, whence he could not be taken
without the Governor’s consent. This was obtained, but
there were so many similar rascals taking sanctuary in the
Island, that it was not deemed prudent to execute the warrant
in the daytime, and Daniels was arrested at night.
Great was the uproar in the morning when the rogues found
their companion had gone, and an indignation meeting was
held to protest against the violation of their rights. He was
brought before the Lord Mayor on 16th Sept., but, owing
to some technicalities, he was let go, although he had to
make his appearance at a Commission of Bankruptcy.</p>

<p>In 1814 there was an attempted fraud on the Stock
Exchange, which was the most daring ever perpetrated. It
was executed by one Charles Random de Berenger, a French
refugee, and an officer in one of the foreign regiments. It
was alleged that, with him, were associated Lord Cochrane,
the Hon. Andrew Cochrane Johnstone, and several others.
It appears from the evidence on the trial, that, early in the
morning of the 21st of February, a gentleman, dressed in a
grey greatcoat over a scarlet uniform, on which was a star,
knocked at the door of the Ship Inn at Dover, and said that
he was the bearer of very important despatches from France.
This gentleman, all the witnesses swore, was Berenger.</p>

<p>He sent a letter, signed R. Du Bourg, Lieut.-Colonel, and
Aide-de-Camp to Lord Cathcart, to Admiral Foley, the Port
Admiral at Dover, advising him that he had just arrived
from Calais with the news of a great victory obtained by the
Allies over Bonaparte, who was slain, in his flight, by the
Cossacks, and that the Allied Sovereigns were in Paris.
Berenger posted up to London, which he entered, having his
horses decked with laurels, in order to make a stir. It was
felt on the Stock Exchange. <i>Omnium</i>, which opened at
27-1/2 rose to 33; but, as the day wore on, and no confirmation
came of the news, they receded to 28-1/2. Business in
that Stock was done, that day, to the tune of half a million
of money. Lord Cochrane and others had, previously, given
instructions to sell Omniums for them, on the 21st of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
February, to an enormous amount. One deposed that, on
that date, he sold&mdash;</p>

</table>

<p class="pn1">And he further deposed that he always considered that any
business he did for Mr Butt was to be placed to Lord
Cochrane’s account.</p>

<p>Another stockbroker sold for the same three gentlemen
£565,000 Omnium. Another had sold £80,000 on their
account, and yet another had had instructions to sell a very
large sum for the same parties, but had refused.</p>

<p>In the end, Lord Cochrane and Mr Butt were condemned
to pay to the King a fine of a Thousand Pounds each, and
J. P. Holloway Five Hundred; and these three, together
with De Berenger, Sandon, and Lyte, were sentenced to
imprisonment in the Marshalsea for twelve calendar months.
Further, Lord Cochrane, De Berenger, and Butt were to
stand in the pillory for one hour, before the Royal Exchange,
once during their imprisonment. This latter part
of their punishment was, afterwards, remitted. Lord Cochrane’s
name was struck off the Navy List, he was expelled
from the House of Commons, his Arms were taken down
from his stall, as Knight of the Bath, his banner torn down,
and kicked ignominiously out of Henry VII.’s Chapel in
Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>By very many he was believed innocent, and, on his seat
for Westminster being declared vacant, he was enthusiastically
re-elected. He escaped from custody, was captured,
and had to serve his time. On June 20, 1815, he was told
his imprisonment was at an end, if he would pay the fine
imposed upon him; and, on July 3rd, he reluctantly did so,
with a £1000 bank note, on the back of which he wrote:&mdash;“My
health having suffered by long and close confinement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
and my oppressors having resolved to deprive me of property,
or life, I submit to robbery, to protect myself from
murder, in the hope that I shall live to bring the delinquents
to justice.”</p>

<p>On the very day he was released, he took his seat again
in the House of Commons; and, in 1832, he received a
“free pardon,” was restored to the Navy List, gazetted a
rear-admiral, and presented at a Levée!</p>

<p>The year 1825 was remarkable for the number of bubble
companies which were floated or not, and for the dreadful
commercial panic which ensued, during which over seventy
banks collapsed in London, or the country. Over
£11,000,000 were subscribed to foreign loans, and
£17,500,000 to different companies. In Parliament there
were presented 439 private bills for companies, and Acts
were passed for 288. Horace Smith sings of them thus:</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“Early and late, where’er I rove,</p>
<p class="ppn6">In park or square, suburb or grove,</p>

<p class="p1">In 1845 began the most wonderful era of gambling in
modern times, the Railway Mania, which rose to such a
height that it was noticed on Oct. 25. “During the past
week there were announced, in three newspapers, eighty-nine
new schemes, with a capital of £84,055,000; during the
month, there were 357 new schemes announced, with an
aggregate capital of £332,000,000.”</p>

<p>On 17th Nov. <i>The Times</i> published a table of all the railway
companies registered up to the 31st October, numbering
1428, and involving an outlay of £701,243,208. “Take
away,” it said, “£140,000,000 for railways completed, or in
progress, exclude all the most extravagant schemes, and
divide the remainder by ten, can we add from our present
resources, even a tenth of the vast remainder? Can we
add £50,000,000 to the railway speculations we are already
irretrievably embarked in? We cannot, without the most
ruinous, universal and desperate confusion.”</p>

<p>The <i>Annual Register</i> for 1845 gives a graphic account of
an incident in the Railway Mania. “An extraordinary scene
occurred at the office of the Railway Department of the
Board of Trade, on this day (Sunday, 30th Nov.), being the
last day on which the plans of the new projects could be
deposited with the Railway Board, in order to enable Bills
to authorise them, to be brought before Parliament, in compliance
with the Standing Orders.</p>

<p>“Last year, the number of projects in respect of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
plans were lodged with the Board of Trade, was 248: the
number, this year, is stated to be 815. The projectors of
the Scotch lines were mostly in advance, and had their plans
duly lodged on Saturday. The Irish projectors, too, and
the old established Companies, seeking powers to construct
branches, were among the more punctual. But, upwards of
600 plans remained to be deposited. Towards the last, the
utmost exertions were made to forward them. The efforts
of the lithographic draughtsmen and printers in London
were excessive; people remained at work night after night,
snatching a hasty repose for a couple of hours on lockers,
benches, or the floor. Some found it impossible to execute
their contracts; others did their work imperfectly. One of
the most eminent was compelled to bring over four hundred
lithographers from Belgium, and failed, nevertheless, with
this reinforcement, in completing some of his plans. Post
horses and express trains, to bring to town plans prepared
in the country, were sought in all parts. Horses were engaged
days before, and kept, by persons specially appointed,
under lock and key. Some railway companies exercised
their power of refusing express trains for rival projects, and
clerks were obliged to make sudden and embarrassing
changes of route, in order to travel by less hostile ways. A
large establishment of clerks were in attendance to register
the deposits; and this arrangement went on very well until
eleven o’clock, when the delivery grew so rapid, that the
clerks were quite unable to keep pace with the arrivals.
The entrance hall soon became inconveniently crowded, considerable
anxiety being expressed lest twelve o’clock should
arrive ere the requisite formalities should have been gone
through. This anxiety was allayed by the assurance that
admission into the hall before that hour would be sufficient
to warrant the reception of the documents. As the clock
struck twelve, the doors of the office were about to be closed,
when a gentleman, with the plans of one of the Surrey railways,
arrived, and, with the greatest difficulty, succeeded in
obtaining admission. A lull of a few minutes here occurred;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
but, just before the expiration of the first quarter of an hour,
a post chaise, with reeking horses, drove up to the entrance,
in hot haste. In a moment, its occupants (three gentlemen)
alighted, and rushed down the passage, towards the office
door, each bearing a plan of Brobdingnagian dimensions.
On reaching the door, and finding it closed, the countenances
of all dropped; but one of them, more valorous than the
rest, and prompted by the bystanders, gave a loud pull at
the bell. It was answered by Inspector Otway, who informed
the ringer it was now too late, and that his plans
could not be received. The agents did not wait for the
conclusion of the unpleasant communication, but took
advantage of the doors being opened, and threw in their
papers, which broke the passage lamp in their fall. They
were thrown back into the street; and when the door was
again opened, again went in the plans, only to meet a
similar fate. In the whole, upwards of 600 plans were
duly deposited.”</p>

<p>Mr Francis, in his “History of the English Railway,” says:
“The daily press was thoroughly deluged with advertisements;
double sheets did not supply space enough for
them; double doubles were resorted to, and, then, frequently,
insertions were delayed. It has been estimated
that the receipts of the leading journals averaged, at one
period, £12,000 and £14,000, a week, from this source.
The railway papers, on some occasions, contained advertisements
that must have netted from £700 to £800 on each
publication. The printer, the lithographer, and the stationer,
with the preparation of prospectuses, the execution of maps,
and the supply of other requisites, also made a considerable
harvest.</p>

<p>“The leading engineers were, necessarily, at a great
premium. Mr Brunel was said to be connected with
fourteen lines, Mr Robert Stephenson with thirty-four,
Mr Locke with thirty-one, Mr Rastrick with seventeen,
and other engineers with one hundred and thirteen.</p>

<p>“The novelist has appropriated this peculiar portion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
commercial history, and, describing it, says, gravely and
graphically: ‘A Colony of solicitors, engineers and seedy
accountants, settled in the purlieus of Threadneedle Street.
Every town and parish in the kingdom blazed out in zinc
plates over the doorways. From the cellar to the roof,
every fragment of a room held its committee. The darkest
cupboard on the stairs contained a secretary or a clerk.
Men who were never seen east of Temple Bar before, or
since, were, now, as familiar to the pavement of Moorgate
Street,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> as the Stockbrokers: ladies of title, lords, members
of Parliament, and fashionable loungers thronged the noisy
passages, and were jostled by adventurers, by gamblers, rogues
and impostors.’</p>

<p>“The advantages of competition were pointed out, with the
choicest phraseology. Lines which passed by barren districts,
and by waste heaths, the termini of which were in
uninhabitable places, reached a high premium. The shares
of one Company rose 2400 per cent. Everything was to
pay a large dividend; everything was to yield a large
profit. One railway was to cross the entire Principality
without a single curve.</p>

<p>“The shares of another were issued; the company formed,
and the directors appointed, with only the terminal points
surveyed. In the Ely railway, not one person connected
with the country through which it was to pass, subscribed
the title-deed.</p>

<p>“The engineers, who were examined in favour of particular
lines, promised all and everything, in their evidence. It was
humorously said, ‘they plunge through the bowels of
mountains; they undertake to drain lakes; they bridge
valleys with viaducts; their steepest gradients are gentle
undulations; their curves are lines of beauty; they interrupt
no traffic; they touch no prejudice.’</p>

<p>“Labour of all kinds increased in demand. The price of
iron rose from sixty-eight shillings to one hundred and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
twenty per ton. Money remained abundant. Promoters
received their tens and twenties of thousands. Rumours of
sudden fortunes were very plentiful. Estates were purchased
by those who were content with their gains; and, to crown
the whole, a grave report was circulated, that Northumberland
House, with its princely remembrances, and palatial
grandeur, was to be bought by the South Western. Many
of the railways attained prices which staggered reasonable
men. The more worthless the article, the greater seemed
the struggle to obtain it. Premiums of £5 and £6 were
matters of course, even where there were four or five competitors
for the road. One Company, which contained a
clause to lease it at three and a half per cent., for 999 years,
rose to twenty premium, so mad were the many to speculate.</p>

<p>“Every branch of commerce participated in the advantages
of an increased circulation. The chief articles of trade met
with large returns; profits were regular; and all luxuries
which suited an affluent community, procured an augmented
sale. Banking credit remained facile; interest still kept
low; money, speaking as they of the City speak, could be
had for next to nothing. It was advanced on everything
which bore a value, whether readily convertible, or not.
Bill brokers would only allow one and a half per cent. for
cash; and what is one and a half per cent. to men who
revelled in the thought of two hundred? The exchanges
remained remarkably steady. The employment of the
labourer on the new lines, of the operative in the factory,
of the skilled artisan in the workshop, of the clerk at the
desk, tended to add to the delusive feeling, and was one of
the forms in which, for a time, the population was benefited.
But, when the strength of the kingdom is wasted in gambling,
temporary, indeed, is the good compared with the
cost. Many, whose money was safely invested, sold at any
price, to enter the share market. Servants withdrew their
hoards from the savings banks. The tradesman crippled
his business. The legitimate love of money became a fierce
lust. The peer came from his club to his brokers; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
clergyman came from his pulpit to the mart; the country
gentleman forsook the calmness of his rural domain for the
feverish excitement of Threadneedle Street. Voluptuous
tastes were indulged in by those who were previously starving.
The new men vied with the old, in the luxurious
adornments of their houses. Everyone smiled with contentment;
every face wore a pleased expression. Some,
who, by virtue of their unabashed impudence, became provisional
committee men, supported the dignity of their
position, in a style which raised the mirth of many, and
moved the envy of more. Trustees, who had no money
of their own, or, who had lost it, used that which was confided
to them; brothers speculated with the money of sisters;
sons gambled with the money of their widowed mothers;
children risked their patrimony; and, it is no exaggeration
to say, that the funds of hundreds were surreptitiously
endangered by those in whose control they were placed.”</p>

<p>The Marquis of Clanricarde, in a speech, spoke very boldly
as to the status, social and financial, of some of the subscribers
to Railway Companies. Said he: “One of the names
to the deed to which he was anxious to direct their attention,
was that of a gentleman, said to reside in Finsbury
Square, who had subscribed to the amount of £25,000: he
was informed no such person was known at that address.
There was, also, in the Contract deed, the name of an individual
who had figured in the Dublin and Galway Railway case,
who was down for £5000, and who was understood to be a
half-pay officer, in the receipt of £54 a-year, but, who appeared
as a subscriber in different railway schemes, to the amount
of £41,500. The address of another, whose name was down
for £12,200, was stated to be in Watling Street, but it
appeared he did not reside there. In the case of another
individual down for £12,500 a false address was found to
have been given. Another individual, whom he would not
name, was a curate in a parish in Kent; he might be
worth all the money for which he appeared responsible in
various railway schemes, but his name appeared for £25,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
in different projects, and stood for £10,000 in this line.
Another individual, who was down for £25,000, was represented
to be in poor circumstances. A clerk in a public
company was down for upwards of £50,000. There were
several more cases of the same kind, but he trusted that he
had stated enough to establish the necessity of referring the
matter to a committee. There were, also, two brothers, sons
of a charwoman, living in a garret, one of whom had signed
for £12,500, and the other for £25,000; these two brothers,
excellent persons, no doubt, but who were receiving about
a guinea and a half between them, were down for £37,000.”</p>

<p>“The night was stormy and dark, the town was shut up in sleep: Only
those were abroad who were out on the lark, Or those who’d no beds to
keep.</p>

<p>I passed through the lonely street, The wind did sing and blow; I
could hear the policeman’s feet, Clapping to and fro.</p>

<p>There stood a potato man, in the midst of all the wet; He stood with
his ‘tato can, in the lonely Haymarket.</p>

<p>Two gents of dismal mien, and dank and greasy rags; came out of a
shop for gin, swaggering over the flags:</p>

<p>Swaggering over the stones, these shabby bucks did walk; and I went
and followed those seedy ones, and listened to their talk.</p>

<p>Was I sober or awake? Could I believe my ears? Those dismal beggars
spake of nothing but Railroad Shares.</p>

<p>I wondered more and more: Says one, ‘Good friend of mine, how
many shares did you write for? In the Diddlesex Junction line?’</p>

<p>‘I wrote for twenty,’ says Jim, ‘but they wouldn’t give me one’; His
comrade straight rebuked him, for the folly he had done.</p>

<p>‘Oh Jim, you are unawares of the ways of this bad town: I always
write for five hundred shares, and <i>then</i> they put me down.’</p>

<p>‘And yet you got no shares,’ says Jim, ‘for all your boast’: ‘I <i>would</i>
have wrote,’ says Jack, ‘but where was the penny to pay the post?’</p>

<p>‘I lost, for I couldn’t pay that first instalment up; but here’s ‘taters
smoking hot&mdash;I say, Let’s stop, my boy, and sup.’</p>

<p>And, at this simple feast, the while they did regale, I drew each ragged
capitalist, down on my left thumb nail.</p>

<p>Their talk did me perplex, All night I tumbled and tost; and thought
of railroad specs, and how money was won and lost.</p>

<p>‘Bless railroads everywhere,’ I said, ‘and the world’s advance; Bless
every railroad share in Italy, Ireland, France; for never a beggar need
now despair, and every rogue has a chance.’”</p></div>

<p class="p1">But, should anyone wish to watch the progress of the
Railway Mania, I would recommend a perusal of <i>Punch</i>,
Vol. ix., in which appears, <i>inter alia</i>, <i>Jeames’s Diary</i>, by
Thackeray, afterwards published as <i>The Diary of C. Jeames
De la Pluche, Esq.</i> The idea was started on p. 59, under
the heading of&mdash;</p>

<h3>A LUCKY SPECULATOR.</h3>

<div class="pbq">

<p>Considerable sensation has been excited in the upper and lower circles
in the West End, by a startling piece of good fortune which has befallen
<span class="smcap">James Plush</span>, Esq., lately footman in a respected family in Berkeley
Square.</p>

<p>One day, last week, Mr James waited upon his master, who is a
banker in the city; and, after a little blushing and hesitation, said he
had saved a little money in service, and was anxious to retire, and to
invest his savings to advantage.</p>

<p>His master (we believe we may mention, without offending delicacy,
the well known name of Sir <span class="smcap">George Flimsy</span> of the firm of <span class="smcap">Flimsy</span>,
<span class="smcap">Diddler</span>, and <span class="smcap">Flash</span>,) smilingly asked Mr <span class="smcap">James</span>, what was the amount
of his savings, wondering considerably how&mdash;out of an income of thirty
guineas, the main part of which he spent in bouquets, silk stockings and
perfumery&mdash;Mr <span class="smcap">Plush</span> could have managed to lay by anything.</p>

<p>Mr <span class="smcap">Plush</span>, with some hesitation, said he had been <i>speculating in
railroads</i>, and stated his winnings to have been thirty thousand pounds.
He had commenced his speculations with twenty, borrowed from a fellow
servant. He had dated his letters from the house in Berkeley Square,
and humbly begged pardon of his master, for not having instructed the
railway secretaries, who answered the applications, to apply at the
area bell.</p>

<p>Sir <span class="smcap">George</span>, who was at breakfast, instantly rose, and shook Mr P.
by the hand; <span class="smcap">Lady Flimsy</span> begged him to be seated, and partake of the
breakfast which he had laid on the table; and has subsequently invited
him to her grand <i>dejeuner</i> at Richmond, where it was observed that Miss
<span class="smcap">Emily Flimsy</span>, her beautiful and accomplished seventh daughter, paid
the lucky gentleman <i>marked attention</i>.</p>

<p>We hear it stated that Mr P. is of very ancient family (<span class="smcap">Hugo de la
Pluche</span> came over with the Conqueror); and the new Brougham which
he has started, bears the ancient coat of his race.</p>

<p>He has taken apartments at the Albany, and is a director of thirty-three
railroads. He purposes to stand for Parliament at the next general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
election, on decidedly conservative principles, which have always been
the politics of his family.</p>

<p>Report says, that, even in his humble capacity, Miss <span class="smcap">Emily Flimsy</span>
had remarked his high demeanour. Well, ‘none but the brave,’ say we,
‘deserve the fair.’&mdash;<i>Morning Paper.</i></p></div>

<p class="p1">This announcement will explain the following lines, which
have been put into our box, with a West End post mark.
If, as we believe, they are written by the young woman from
whom the Millionaire borrowed the sum on which he raised
his fortune, what heart would not melt with sympathy at
her tale, and pity the sorrows which she expresses in such
artless language?</p>

<p>If it be not too late: if wealth have not rendered its
possessor callous: if poor <span class="smcap">Maryanne</span> <i>be still alive</i>, we
trust Mr <span class="smcap">Plush</span> will do her justice.</p>

<p class="ppn8">For hever <span class="smcap">Jeames</span>, of Buckley Square.”</p>

<p class="p1">But, joking apart, there is no exaggeration in Jeames.
Look at a “Return to the Order of the Honourable the
House of Commons, dated 8th April 1845, for an Alphabetical
list of the Names, Description, and Place of Abode
of all Persons subscribing to the Amount of £2000 and
upwards to any Railway Subscription Contract deposited in
the Private Bill Office during the present Session of Parliament,”
and amongst the names will be found many of the
leading nobility, large manufacturing firms, names well
known in commerce and literature, mingled together in a
most heterogeneous manner. The same columns shew a
combination of peers and printers, vicars and vice-admirals,
spinsters and half-pay officers, M.P.’s and special pleaders,
professors and cotton spinners, gentlemen’s cooks and Q.C.’s,
attorney’s clerks and college scouts, waiters at Lloyd’s,
relieving officers and excisemen, barristers and butchers,
Catholic priests and coachmen, editors and engineers, dairymen
and dyers, braziers, bankers, beer sellers and butlers,
domestic servants, footmen and mail guards, and almost
every calling under the sun.</p>

<p>These, it must be remembered, were subscribers for £2000
and upwards; those who subscribed for less, were supposed
to be holders of £21,386,703, 6s. 4d. in Stock.</p>

<p>The first blow given to this frightful gambling was on
Thursday, 16th Oct. 1845, when the Bank of England raised
its Discount, which had such a disastrous effect, that by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
Saturday, people began to be alarmed, and, as Mr Francis
describes the situation, “Money was scarce, the price of
stock and scrip lowered; the confidence of the people was
broken, and a vision of a dark future on every face. Advertisements
were suddenly withdrawn from the papers; names
of note were seen no more as provisional committee men;
distrust followed the merchant to the mart, and the jobber
to the Exchange. The new schemes ceased to be regarded;
applications ceased to be forwarded; premiums were either
lowered, or ceased to exist. Bankers looked anxiously to
the accounts of their customers; bill brokers scrutinised
their securities; and every man was suspicious of his
neighbour.</p>

<p>“But the distrust was not confined to projected lines.
Established Railways felt the shock, and were reduced in
value. Consols fell one and a half per cent.; Exchequer
Bills declined in price, and other markets sympathised. The
people had awoke from their dream, and trembled. It was
a national alarm.</p>

<p>“Words are weak to express the fears and feelings which
prevailed. There was no village too remote to escape the
shock, and there was, probably, no house in town, some
occupant of which did not shrink from the morrow. The
Statesman started to find his new Bank Charter so sadly,
and so suddenly tried: the peer, who had so thoughtlessly
invested, saw ruin opening to his view. Men hurried with
bated breath to their brokers; the allottee was uneasy and
suspicious: the provisional committee man grew pale at his
fearful responsibility: directors ceased to boast their blushing
honours, and promoters saw their expected profits
evaporate. Shares, which, the previous week, were a
fortune, were, the next, a fatality to their owners. The
reputed shareholders were not found when they were
wanted: provisional committee men were not more easy
of access.</p>

<p>“One Railway advertised the names and addresses of thirty&mdash;none
of whom were to be heard of at the residences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
ascribed to them. Letters were returned to the Post Office,
day after day. Nor is this to be wondered at, when it is
said that, on one projected line, only £60 was received for
deposits which should have yielded £700,000.</p>

<p>“It was proved in the Committee of the House of Commons,
that one subscription list was formed of ‘lame ducks
of the Alley’; and that, in another, several of the Directors,
including the Chairman, had, also, altered their several
subscriptions to the amount of £100,000, the very evening
on which the list was deposited, and that five shillings a
man was given to any one who would sign for a certain
number of shares.</p>

<p>“Nothing more decidedly marked the crisis which had
arrived, than the fact that every one hastened to disown
railways. Gentlemen who had been buried in prospectuses,
whose names and descriptions had been published under
every variation that could fascinate the public, who had
figured as committee men, and received the precious guineas
for their attendance, were eager to assure the world that
they were ignorant of this great transgression. Men, who, a
month before, had boasted of the large sums they had made
by scrip, sent advertisements to papers denying their responsibility,
or appealed to the Lord Mayor to protect their
characters. Members of Parliament who had remained
quiet under the infliction, while it was somewhat respectable,
fell back upon their privileges when they saw their
purses in danger. There is no doubt that an unauthorised use
of names was one feature of fraudulent Companies, and that,
amid a list of common names, it was thought a distinguished
one might pass unnoticed. The complaints, therefore, of
those who were thus unceremoniously treated were just; but
the great mass of denials emanated from persons who,
knowingly, encountered the risk, and meanly shrunk from
the danger.</p>

<p>“It is the conviction of those who are best informed that
no other panic was ever so fatal to the middle class. It
reached every hearth, it saddened every heart in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
metropolis. Entire families were ruined. There was
scarcely an important town in England, but what beheld
some wretched suicide. Daughters, delicately nurtured,
went out to seek their bread; sons were recalled from
academies; households were separated: homes were
desecrated by the emissaries of the law. There was a
disruption of every social tie. The debtor’s jails were
peopled with promoters; Whitecross Street was filled with
speculators; and the Queen’s bench was full to overflowing.
Men who had lived comfortably and independently,
found themselves suddenly responsible for sums they had
no means of paying. In some cases they yielded their all,
and began the world anew; in others, they left the country
for the continent, laughed at their creditors, and defied
pursuit. One gentleman was served with four hundred
writs: a peer, similarly pressed, when offered to be relieved
from all liabilities for £15,000, betook himself to his
yacht, and forgot, in the beauties of the Mediterranean,
the difficulties which had surrounded him. Another gentleman,
who, having nothing to lose, surrendered himself to
his creditors, was a director of more than twenty lines. A
third was Provisional Committee man to fifteen. A fourth,
who commenced life as a printer, who became an insolvent
in 1832, and a bankrupt in 1837, who had negotiated
partnerships, who had arranged embarrassed affairs, who
had collected debts, and turned his attention to anything,
did not disdain, also, to be a railway promoter, a railway
director, or to spell his name in a dozen different ways.”</p>

<p>But a notice of the Railway Mania would be very incomplete
without mention of George Hudson, the Railway King.
He was born at Howsham, a village near York, in March
1800, was apprenticed to a draper in York, and subsequently
became principal in the business; thus, early in
life, becoming well off, besides having £30,000 left him by
a distant relative. In 1837 he was Lord Mayor of York,
and the same year was made Chairman of the York and
North Midland Railway, which was opened in 1839. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
1841 he was elected Chairman of the Great North of
England Company, and, afterwards held the same position
in the Midland Railway Company. He speculated largely
in Railways; and in the Parliamentary return, already
alluded to (p. 270) his subscriptions appear as £319,835.</p>

<p>He came to London, and inhabited the house at Albert
Gate, Knightsbridge (now the French Embassy) where he
entertained the Prince Consort, and the aristocracy generally.
He was elected M.P. for Sunderland in Aug. 1845, and
again served as Lord Mayor of York in 1846. The Railway
smash came, and year by year things went worse with
him, until, early in the year 1849 he had to resign his
chairmanship of the Eastern Counties (now Great Eastern),
Midland, York, Newcastle and Berwick, and the York and
North Midland Railway Companies. He went abroad,
where he lived for some time, and tried, unavailingly, to
retrieve his fortune. In July 1865 he was committed to
York Castle for Contempt of the Court of Exchequer, in
not paying a large debt, and was there incarcerated till the
following October.</p>

<p>He fell so low, that in 1868 some friends took pity on
him and raised a subscription for him, thus obtaining £4800,
with which an annuity was purchased. He died in London,
14th Dec. 1871.</p>

<p>In conclusion, as a place for gambling, the Stock Exchange
is of far greater extent than the Turf. The time bargains
and options, without which the business of the Exchange
would be very little, are gambling pure and simple, whilst
the numerous <i>bucket shops</i>, with their advertisements and
circulars, disseminate the unwholesome vice of gambling
throughout the length and breadth of the land, enabling
people to speculate without anyone being the wiser. It is
needless to say, that, as on the Turf, they are the losers.</p>

<p class="pch">Permissible gambling&mdash;Early Marine Assurance&mdash;Oldest and old Policies&mdash;Lloyd’s&mdash;Curious
Insurances&mdash;Marine Assurance Companies&mdash;Fire Insurance&mdash;Its
origin and early Companies&mdash;Life Insurance&mdash;Early Companies&mdash;Curious
story of Life Insurance.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="beg">But,</span> paradoxical as it may appear, there is a class of gambling
which is not only considered harmless, but beneficial,
and even necessary&mdash;I mean Insurance. Theoretically, it is
gambling proper. You bet 2s. 6d. to £100 with your Fire
Insurance; you equally bet on a Marine Insurance for the
safe arrival of your ships or merchandise; and it is also
gambling when you insure your life. Yet a man would be
considered culpable, or at the very least, negligent and
indiscreet did he not insure.</p>

<p>Of the different kinds of Insurance or Assurance, as it is
indifferently called, Marine Assurance is the oldest, so old,
that no one knows when the custom began, as we see by the
preamble of 43 Eliz., c. 12 (1601).</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">An Acte concerninge matters of Assurances,

to have from them assurance made of their Goodes Merchandizes
Ships and Things adventured, or some parte thereof,
at such rates and in such sorte as the Parties assurers and
the Parties assured can agree, whiche course of dealinge is
commonly termed a Policie of Assurance; by meanes of
whiche Policies of Assurance it comethe to passe, upon the

undoinge of any Man, but the losse lightethe rather easilie
upon many, then heavilie upon fewe, and rather upon them

to venture more willinglie and more freelie: And whereas
heretofore suche Assurers have used to stand so justlie and
preciselie upon their credites, as fewe or no Controversies have

discreete Merchantes appointed by the Lord Mayor of the

untill of late yeeres that divers persons have withdrawen
themselves from that arbitrarie course, and have soughte to
drawe the parties assured to seeke their moneys of everie

Courtes, to their great charges and delayes: <span class="smcap">For Remedie</span>
<i>wher of be it enacted</i>,” &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>The Oldest Policy of Assurance I have been able to find
is mentioned in the 6th Report of the Royal Commission
on Historical MSS., where it is catalogued “1604. A
Charter partie, An Assurance of fish from Newfoundland.”<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Mr F. Martin, who wrote an exhaustive book on the
<i>History of Lloyd’s and Marine Insurance</i>, says: “The earliest
English policy of marine insurance, which we have been able
to discover, bears date 1613, and though not a document
issued actually by underwriters, but, to all appearances, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
copy made for legal purposes, with some lawyer’s notes
attached, may be found historically interesting. The discovery
was&mdash;with others subsequently to be referred to&mdash;the
result of long and laborious researches among the, as
yet, only partly known literary treasures of the Bodleian
Library at Oxford. The original is among the Tanner
manuscripts, numbered 74, fo. 32, and the manuscript is
endorsed, ‘Mr Morris Abbott’s pollesye of Assurance dated
the 15 of ffebruary 1613, 11 Jacobi.’”</p>

<p>A very old policy hangs, framed and glazed, on the wall
of the Committee Room at Lloyds, dated 20th Jan. 1680,
and it is for £1200&mdash;£200 on the ship and £1000 on the
goods. The ship was the <i>Golden Fleece</i>, the voyage from
Lisbon to Venice, and the premium was £4 per cent.!</p>

<p>Underwriting marine risks was in private hands, and
although the underwriters had, some of them, offices of their
own, most of the business seems to have been done at Coffee
Houses, such as Hain’s, Garraway’s, or Good’s; and there
was also a central office at the Royal Exchange, as is shown
by several early advertisements, one of which is the following,
from the <i>City Mercury</i>, No. 255 (1680):</p>

<p>“Whereas Mr Daniel Parrot caused a Politie to be made
Septemb. 28 last, on the <i>Charles of Plymouth</i>, from Newfoundland
to Cadiz, which is subscribed by several Insurers,
and the Politie lost, and a new Politie made: It is desired
that all persons that have subscribed the Politie would come
into the Insurance Office, and subscribe the new Politie, that
it may be known who the Insurers are; and if any one has
found the old Politie, they are desired to bring it to Mr Tho.
Astley, at the Insurance Office on the Royal Exchange, and
they shall be well rewarded.”</p>

<p>The origin of the present Corporation of Lloyd’s was in
the Coffee House of Edward Lloyd, who, in 1688, lived in
the very busy commercial thoroughfare of Tower Street, as
appears from an advertisement in the <i>London Gazette</i> of
18/21 Feb. 1688, relating to a robbery. In 1691 or 1692
he moved to a more central situation, at the Corner of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
Abchurch Lane and Lombard Street, where, in the summer
of 1696, he started the famous <i>Lloyd’s News</i>, of which the
Bodleian Library has a complete set, with the exception of
the first seven numbers. It only reached seventy-six numbers,
when it was discontinued for the reason given in No.
138 of the <i>Protestant Mercury</i>, Feb. 24/26, 1696 (1697).
“Whereas, in <i>Lloyd’s News</i> of the 23rd instant, it was
inserted, That the House of Lords Received a Petition from
the Quakers, that they may be freed from all Offices, which
being groundless and a mistake, he was desired to rectifie it
in his next: But return’d for Answer, it was added by the
Printer, that he would Print no more at present.” And it
remained in abeyance till 1726, when it was resuscitated
under the title of <i>Lloyd’s List</i>, a name which it now bears.</p>

<p>Lloyd’s Coffee House served its purpose to the Underwriters
for a time, but they found it inconvenient, and
wanted a place of their own, so they took rooms in Pope’s
Head Alley, which they called New Lloyd’s Coffee House,
whilst they were looking out for suitable permanent
premises. Here, towards the end of 1771, seventy-nine
Underwriters met, and each subscribed £100 towards building
a “New Lloyd’s.” After a considerable amount of house
hunting, it was reported by the Committee, on Nov. 24,
1773, “that after many fruitless researches to obtain a
Coffee House in Freeman’s Court and other places, they had
succeeded with the Mercer’s Company for a very roomy and
convenient place over the North West Side of the Royal
Exchange, at the rent of £180 per annum”: and this selection
being approved of, they moved into their new quarters
on 5th March 1774. There they have abode ever since, except
for a brief period when the Exchange was re-building
after its destruction by fire in 1838.</p>

<p>The underwriters did not always confine themselves to
marine risks. Malcolm, writing in 1808, says: “The practice
of betting is tolerably prevalent at present, and by no
means confined to any particular class of the community.
In fact, I am afraid it might be traced very far back in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
history of our Customs; but it will be sufficient, for the
information of the reader, that I present him with an article
from the <i>London Chronicle</i> of 1768, which, I think, will
remind him of some recent transactions in the City.</p>

<p>“‘The introduction and amazing progress of illicit gaming
at Lloyd’s Coffee House is, among others, a powerful
and very melancholy proof of the degeneracy of the times.
It is astonishing that this practice was begun, and has been,
hitherto, carried on, by the matchless effrontery and impudence
of one man. It is equally so, that he has met with
so much encouragement from many of the principal underwriters,
who are, in every other respect, useful members of
society: and it is owing to the lenity of our laws, and want
of spirit in the present administration, that this pernicious
practice has not, hitherto, been suppressed. Though gaming
in any degree (except what is warranted by law) is perverting
the original and useful design of that Coffee House, it
may, in some measure, be excuseable to speculate on the
following subjects:</p>

<p>Mr Wilkes being elected Member for London, which was
done from 5 to 50 guineas per cent.</p>

<p>Ditto for Middlesex, from 20 to 70 guineas per cent.</p>

<p>Alderman B&mdash;&mdash; d’s life for one year, now doing at 7 per
cent.</p>

<p>On Sir J&mdash;&mdash; H&mdash;&mdash; being turned out in one year, now
doing at 20 guineas per cent.</p>

<p>On John Wilkes’s life for one year, now doing at 5 per cent.
N.B.&mdash;Warranted to remain in prison during that period.</p>

<p>On a declaration of war with France or Spain, in one
year, 8 guineas per cent.</p>

<p>And many other innocent things of that kind.</p>

<p>But, when policies come to be opened on two of the first
Peers in Britain losing their heads, within a year, at 10s. 6d.
per cent.; and on the dissolution of the present Parliament,
within one year, at 5 guineas per cent., which are now
actually doing, and underwrote chiefly by Scotsmen, at the
above Coffee House; it is surely high time for administration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
to interfere; and, by exerting the rigours of the laws
against the authors and encouragers of such insurances
(which must be done for some bad purpose), effectually put
a stop to it.’”</p>

<p>In the secretary’s room at Lloyd’s hangs the following
policy:&mdash;“In consideration of three guineas for one hundred
pounds, and according to that rate for every greater or less
sum received of William Dorrington; we, who have hereunto
subscribed our names, do for ourselves, and our respective
heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, and not
one for the other or others of us; or for the heirs, executors,
administrators and assigns of the other or others of us,
assume, engage and promise that we respectively, or our
several and respective heirs, executors, administrators, and
assigns, shall and will pay, or cause to be paid, unto the
said William Dorrington the sum and sums of money which
we have hereunto respectively subscribed without any abatement
whatever.</p>

<p>“<i>In case</i> Napoleon Bonaparte shall cease to exist, or be
taken prisoner on, or before, the 21st day of June 1813,
commencing from this day. London 21 May 1813.”</p>

<p>Although originally intended for the Insurance of Marine
risks only, other policies can be taken out at Lloyd’s&mdash;such
as Fire; against Burglary&mdash;although this was also insured
against during the South Sea Mania, under the title of
“Insurance from housebreakers”; against any lady having
twins. <i>À propos</i> of this, there was an underwriter, some
years ago, at Lloyd’s, named Thornton&mdash;who was fond of
writing speculative risks, especially overdue ships, and who
died very wealthy. He had a bet with a fellow underwriter&mdash;that
he should pay him £1000 for every child the Queen
bore; but, if there should be twins, at any time, then Mr
Thornton was to be paid £20,000. Insuring that a race
horse shall run in a particular race; on interest under a
will; employer’s liability to workmen; accidents by tram-cars;
solvency of commercial firms; earthquakes; and during
the six months preceding the Queen’s Jubilee of 20th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
June 1897 a vast amount was underwritten, guaranteeing
the Queen’s life till that date&mdash;and also assuring that she
should pass through certain streets. But these policies are
not recognised by the Committee, and, should the underwriter
fail, they do not rank for dividend out of the caution
money held by the Corporation.</p>

<p>Besides Lloyd’s Association, where each Member underwrites
the amount he chooses, there are Marine Insurance
Companies, which are of great utility for the large sums
they underwrite. These are not all English, there are many
foreign Marine Insurance Companies having Offices in
London, as may be seen by the following list, which is very
far from being complete:&mdash;Baden Marine, Bavarian Lloyd
Marine, Boston Marine, Canton Marine, German Marine,
Italia Marine of Genoa, Nippon Sea and Land, North
China, Rhenish Westphalian Lloyds, Switzerland Insurance,
Yangtze Insurance Association, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. The first
English Marine Insurance Companies were the Royal Exchange
and the London, both established in 1720.</p>

<p>Insurance against Fire began the year following the Great
Fire of London (1666), and the first Company for Assurance
against Fire was the Phœnix, established about 1682,
first at the Rainbow Coffee House, in Fleet Street, and,
afterwards, near the Royal Exchange. Their system was
to pay 30s. down, and insure £100 for seven years. The
second was The Friendly Society, in Palsgrave Court, without
Temple Bar, which was the first (in 1684) that insured
by mutual contribution, where you could insure £100 for
seven years by paying 6s. 8d. down and an annual subscription
of 1s. 4d. And, thirdly, The Amicable Contributors,
at Tom’s Coffee House in St Martin’s Lane
(commenced about 1695), where a payment of 12s. would
insure £100 for seven years, at the expiration of which time
10s. would be returned to the assured. This Society seems
to have changed its name to the Hand in Hand Fire Office,
who gave up their two establishments, at Tom’s Coffee
House, and the Crown Coffee House, behind the Exchange,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
to more suitable premises in Angel Court, Snow Hill, and
notified the change in the <i>Gazette</i> of 1st Jan. 1714.</p>

<p>This Insurance Company (The Amicable) is generally
considered to be the first institution for the Insurance of
Lives, although Life Annuities had been in practice for a
long time, but a writer in <i>Chambers’ Encyclopædia</i> (Vol. vi.,
p. 175, ed. 1895) says that it did not begin life business
until 1836. The same writer continues: “The earliest
known Life Assurance Company was established in 1699,
and called the ‘Society of Assurance for Widows and
Orphans.’ This was what, now, would be called an <i>Assessment</i>
Company. It did not guarantee a definite sum
assured, in consideration of a fixed periodical premium;
but, by its constitution it was to consist, when full, of 2000
members, who were to contribute 5s. each towards every
death that occurred amongst the members.</p>

<p>“The earliest life assurance policy, of which particulars
have been preserved, was made on 15th June 1583, at the
‘Office of Insurance within the Royal Exchange,’ in London.
Full details of this Policy have been preserved, because it
gave rise to the first authentic disputed claim. The policy
was for £383, 6s. 8d., to be paid to Richard Martin, in the
event of William Gybbons dying within twelve months, and
the policy was underwritten by thirteen different persons
who guaranteed sums of from £25 to £50 each. The
premium was at the rate of 8 per cent. William Gybbons
died on the 28th May 1584, and the underwriters refused
to pay because he had survived twelve months of twenty-eight
days each. The Commissioners appointed to determine
such cases, held that the twelve months mentioned in
the policy meant one full year, and they ordered the underwriters
to pay. These appealed to the Court of Admiralty,
which had jurisdiction in such cases, and where, in 1587,
two judges upheld the decision of the Commissioners, so
that, eventually, the underwriters had to pay.”</p>

<p>Mr Francis<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> tells us of the first known fraud in Life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
Assurance. “About 1730, two persons resided in the then
obscure suburbs of St Giles’s, one of whom was a woman of
about twenty, the other, a man, whose age would have
allowed him to be the woman’s father, and who was, generally
understood to bear that relation. Their position
hovered on the debatable ground between poverty and
competence, or might even be characterised by the modern
term of shabby genteel. They interfered with no one, and
they encouraged no one to interfere with them. No specific
personal description is recorded of them, beyond the fact
that the man was tall and middle aged, bearing a semimilitary
aspect, and that the woman, though young and
attractive in person, was, apparently, haughty and frigid
in her manner. On a sudden, at night time, the latter
was taken very ill. The man sought the wife of his nearest
neighbour for assistance, informing her that his daughter
had been seized with sudden and great pain at the heart.
They returned together, and found her in the utmost
apparent agony, shrinking from the approach of all, and
dreading the slightest touch. The leech was sent for; but,
before he could arrive, she seemed insensible, and he only
entered the room in time to see her die. The father appeared
in great distress, the doctor felt her pulse, placed his hand
on her heart, shook his head, as he intimated all was over,
and went his way. The searchers came, for those birds of
ill-omen were, then, the ordinary haunters of the death-bed,
and the coffin, with its contents, was committed to the
ground. Almost immediately after this, the bereaved father
claimed from the underwriters some money which was insured
on his daughter’s life, left the locality, and the story was
forgotten.</p>

<p>“Not very long after, the neighbourhood of Queen Square,
then a fashionable place, shook its head at the somewhat
unequivocal connection that existed between one of the
inmates of a house in that locality, and a lady who resided
with him. The gentleman wore moustaches, and though
not young, affected what was then known as the Macaroni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
style. The Captain, for that was the almost indefinite title
he assumed, was a visitor to Ranelagh, was an <i>habitué</i>
of the Coffee Houses; and, being an apparently wealthy
person, riding good horses and keeping an attractive mistress,
he attained a certain position among the <i>mauvais sujets</i> of
the day. Like many others at that period, he was, or seemed
to be, a dabbler in the funds; was frequently seen at Lloyd’s
and in the Alley; lounged occasionally at Garraway’s; but
appeared, more particularly, to affect the company of those
who dealt in life assurances.</p>

<p>“His house soon became a resort for the young and
thoughtless, being one of those pleasant places where the
past and the future were alike lost in the present: where
cards were introduced with the wine, and where, if the young
bloods of the day lost their money, they were repaid by a
glance of more than ordinary warmth from the goddess of
the place; and to which, if they won, they returned with
renewed zest. One thing was noticed, they never won from
the master of the house, and there is no doubt, a large portion
of the current expenses were met by the money gambled
away; but, whether it were fairly, or unfairly gained, is,
scarcely a doubtful question.</p>

<p>“A stop was soon put to these amusements. The place
was too remote from the former locality, the appearance of
both characters was too much changed to be identified; or,
in these two might have been traced the strangers of that
obscure suburb, where, as daughter, the woman was supposed
to die; and, as father, the man had wept and raved over her
remains. And a similar scene was, once more, to be acted.
The lady was taken as suddenly ill as before; the same
spasms at the heart seemed to convulse her frame; and,
again, the man hung over her in apparent agony. Physicians
were sent for in haste; only one arrived in time to see her,
once more, imitate the appearance of death; whilst the
others, satisfied that life had fled, took their fees, ‘shook
solemnly their powdered wigs,’ and departed. This mystery,
for it is evident there was some conspiracy, or collusion, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
partially solved when it is said that many thousands were
claimed and received, by the gallant captain from various
underwriters, merchants and companies with whom he had
assured the life of the lady.</p>

<p>“But the hero of this tradition was a consummate actor;
and, though his career is unknown for a long period after
this, yet it is highly probable that he carried out his
nefarious projects in schemes which are difficult to trace.
There is little doubt, however, that the <i>soi-disant</i> captain of
Queen Square was one and the same person who, as a
merchant, a few years later, appeared daily on the commercial
walks of Liverpool; where, deep in the mysteries
of corn and cotton, a constant attendant at church, a subscriber
to local charities, and a giver of good dinners, he
soon became much respected by those who dealt with him
in business, or visited him in social life. The hospitalities
of his house were gracefully dispensed by a lady who passed
as his niece; and, for a time, nothing seemed to disturb the
tenour of his way. At length it became whispered in the
world of commerce, that his speculations were not so successful
as usual; and a long series of misfortunes, as
asserted by him, gave a sanction to the whisper. It soon
became advisable for him to borrow money, and this he
could only do on the security of property belonging to his
niece. To do so, it was necessary to insure their lives for
about £2000. This was easy enough, as Liverpool, no less
than London, was ready to assure anything which promised
profit, and, as the affair was regular, no one hesitated. A
certain amount of secrecy was necessary for the sake of his
credit; and, availing himself of this, he assured on the life
of the niece £2000, with, at least, ten different merchants
and underwriters in London and elsewhere. The game was
once more in his own hands, and the same play was once
more acted. The lady was taken ill, the doctor was called
in, and found her suffering from convulsions. He administered
a specific, and retired. In the night he was again
hastily summoned, but arrived too late. The patient was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
declared to be beyond his skill; and the next morning it
became known to all Liverpool that she had died suddenly.
A decorous grief was evinced by the chief mourner. There
was no haste made in forwarding the funeral; the lady lay
almost in state, so numerous were the friends who called to
see the last of her they had visited; the searchers did their
hideous office gently, for they were, perhaps, largely bribed:
the physician certified that she had died of a complaint he
could scarcely name, and the grave received the Coffin.
The merchant retained his position in Liverpool, and bore
himself with a decent dignity; made no immediate application
for the money; scarcely even alluded to the assurances
which were due, and, when they were named, exhibited an
appearance of almost indifference. He had, however, selected
his victims with skill. They were safe men, and, from them,
he duly received the money which was assured on the life of
his niece.</p>

<p>“From this period he seemed to decline in health,
expressed a loathing for the place where he had once been
so happy; change of air was prescribed, and he left the
men whom he had deceived, chuckling at the success of his
infamous scheme.”</p>

<p>Nowadays, everything insurable can be insured; you can
be compensated for accidents; if your plate glass windows
are broken, if hail spoils your crops, or if your cattle die;
the fidelity of your servants can be guaranteed: in fact, this
field of permissible gambling is fully covered&mdash;whilst betting
on horse racing rears its head unchecked, stock jobbers
thrive, bucket shops multiply, and so do their victims.</p>

<p class="pc1"><span class="smcap">Extract from the Editor’s Preface.</span></p>

<p class="p1">“The original numbers of <i>The Tatler</i> were re-issued in two forms in
1710-11; one edition, in octavo, being published by subscription, while
the other, in duodecimo, was for the general public. The present
edition has been printed from a copy of the latter issue, which, as
recorded on the title-page, was ‘revised and corrected by the Author’;
but I have had by my side, for constant reference, a complete set
of the folio sheets, containing the ‘Lucubrations of Isaac Bickerstaff’
in the form in which they were first presented to the world. Scrupulous
accuracy in the text has been aimed at, but the eccentricities of spelling&mdash;which
were the printer’s, not the author’s&mdash;have not been preserved,
and the punctuation has occasionally been corrected.</p>

<p>“The first and the most valuable of the annotated editions of <i>The
Tatler</i> was published by John Nichols and others in 1786, with notes
by Bishop Percy, Dr John Calder, and Dr Pearce; and though these
notes are often irrelevant and out of date, they contain an immense
amount of information, and have been freely made use of by subsequent
editors. I have endeavoured to preserve what is of value in the older
editions, and to supplement it, as concisely as possible, by such further
information as appeared desirable. The eighteenth century diaries and
letters published of late years have in many cases enabled me to
throw light on passages which have hitherto been obscure, and sometimes
useful illustrations have been found in the contemporary newspapers
and periodicals.”</p>

<div class="reduct">
<p class="p2">This edition reproduces the text, spelling, punctuation, etc., of 1798, and gives in an
Appendix Wordsworth’s <i>Peter Bell</i> (original text, now reprinted for the first time), and
Coleridge’s <i>Lewti</i>, <i>The Three Graves</i>, and <i>The Wanderings of Cain</i>. It also contains
reproductions in photogravure of the portraits of Wordsworth (by Hancock, 1798) and
of Coleridge (by Peter Vandyke, 1795), now in the National Portrait Gallery.</p>

<p>The publishers have in preparation further carefully annotated editions of books in
English literature, to be produced in the same style as their edition of the “Lyrical
Ballads”&mdash;not too small for the shelf, and not too large to be carried about&mdash;further
announcements concerning which will be made in due course. It is not intended to
include in this series, as a rule, the oft-reprinted “classics,” of which there are already
sufficiently desirable issues.</p>

<p><i>Athenæum</i> (4 col. review).&mdash;“Mr Hutchinson’s centenary edition of the Lyrical
Ballads is not a mere reprint, for it is enriched with a preface and notes which make it
a new book. The preface contains much that is suggestive in explaining the history
and elucidating the meaning of this famous little volume. Mr Hutchinson’s notes are
especially deserving of praise.”</p>

<p><i>St James’s Gazette.</i>&mdash;“‘Lyrical Ballads’ was published September 1, 1798. By a
happy thought this centenary is in anticipation very fitly celebrated&mdash;without fuss or
futilities&mdash;by the publication of an admirable reprint of ‘Lyrical Ballads,’ with an
adequate ‘apparatus criticus’ by Mr T. Hutchinson, the well-known Wordsworthian
scholar, whose name makes recommendation superfluous. This is a book that no
library should be without&mdash;not the ‘gentleman’s library’ of Charles Lamb’s sarcasm,
but any library where literature is respected.”</p>

<p><i>Notes and Queries.</i>&mdash;“The book is indeed a precious boon. Mr Hutchinson is in
his line one of the foremost of scholars, and his introduction is a commendable piece of
work. No less excellent are his notes, which are both readable and helpful. One cannot
do otherwise than rejoice in the possession of the original text, now faithfully
reproduced. A volume which is sure of a place in the library of every lover of
poetry.”</p>

<p><i>Globe.</i>&mdash;“It is delightful to have them in the charming form given to them in the
present volume, for which Mr Hutchinson has written not only a very informing introduction,
but also some very luminous and useful notes. The book is one which every
lover and student of poetry must needs add to his collection.”</p>

<p class="pc4 large">MODERN PLAYS.</p>

<p class="pc1 mid">Edited by R. Brimley Johnson and N. Erichsen.</p>

<p class="p1">It is the aim of this series to represent, as widely as possible, the
activity of the modern drama&mdash;not confined to stage performance&mdash;in
England and throughout the continent of Europe. It so happens that,
though translations seem to be more in demand every day, the greater
number of the Continental dramatists are at present little known in this
country. Among them will be found predecessors and followers of
Ibsen or Maeterlinck; as well as others who reflect more independently
the genius of their own country.</p>

<p><i>Love’s Comedy</i>, which marks a transition from the early romantic to
the later social plays, is the only important work of Ibsen’s not yet
translated into English. The name of Strindberg, whose position in
Sweden may be compared to that of Ibsen in Norway, will be almost
new to the English public. Villiers’ <i>La Révolte</i> is a striking forecast
of <i>The Doll’s House</i>. Verhaeren is already known here as one of the
foremost of Belgian writers, who, like Maeterlinck, uses the French
tongue; and Brieux is among the most attractive of the younger native
French dramatists. Ostrovsky’s <i>The Storm</i>, painting “The Dark
World,” is generally recognised as <i>the</i> characteristic Russian drama.
<i>The Convert</i>, by Stepniak, will be specially interesting as its author’s
only dramatic attempt.</p>

<p>The work of translation has been entrusted to English writers specially
conversant with the literatures represented, who, in many cases, are
already associated in the public mind with the authors they are here
interpreting. Every play will be translated <i>in extenso</i>, and, if in verse,
as nearly as possible in the original metres. The volumes will contain
brief introductions, bibliographical and explanatory rather than critical,
and such annotations as may be necessary.</p>

<p>The volumes will be printed in pott quarto, and they will cost, as a
rule, 2s. 6d. net. or 3s. 6d. net. each.</p>

<p class="pc4 large"><i>KNAPP, ARTHUR MAY.</i></p>

<p class="pch mid">FEUDAL AND MODERN JAPAN, <span class="reduct">by Arthur May
Knapp. 2 vols., with 24 photogravure illustrations of
Japanese life, landscape and architecture. Small fcap.
8vo, ¼-bound, white cloth, blue sides, gilt top. 8s. net.</span></p>

<div class="reduct">
<p class="p2">The work of one who has frequently visited, and for a long time resided in Japan,
thus enjoying peculiar advantages for observation and comment.</p>

<p>The scope of the book includes a study of the history, religion, language, art, life,
and habits of the Japanese.</p>

<p>Though written in a thoroughly appreciative spirit, it avoids the indiscriminating
praise which has characterised so many works on Japan; and while covering ground
which has become somewhat familiar, it presents many fresh points of view, and furnishes
much information heretofore inaccessible to the ordinary reader.</p>
</div>

<p class="pc4 large"><i>ROSSETTI, DANTE GABRIEL.</i></p>

<p class="pch mid">THE BLESSED DAMOZEL, <span class="reduct">by Dante Gabriel
Rossetti. With an Introduction by Wm. Michael Rossetti,
a reproduction in Photogravure of D. G. Rossetti’s
crayon study for the head of the Blessed Damozel, and
decorative designs and cover by W. B. Macdougall.
Fcap. 4to, 1/4-bound, art vellum, gilt top. 5s. net. (<i>See
Special Prospectus.</i>)</span></p>

<div class="reduct">
<p class="p2">The poem given here is as it originally appeared in <i>The Germ</i>, and consequently the
version is one hitherto practically inaccessible. Mr W. M. Rossetti’s Introduction deals
fully with the history of its composition and the changes through which it subsequently
went.</p>

<p><i>Illustrated London News.</i>&mdash;“A fine bit of decorative art and an excellent sample of
modern format. The frontispiece is very beautiful. Mr Macdougall’s designs are rich.”</p>

<p><i>The Sketch.</i>&mdash;“It is really beautifully illustrated. The book is a veritable art
treasure.”</p>

<p><i>Speaker.</i>&mdash;“This artistic and singularly interesting volume.”</p>

<p><i>Birmingham Gazette.</i>&mdash;“Every page contains a broad framework of beautiful design,
in which the artist manifests his power in glorious sweeping lines and delicate tracery.
A treasure to be appreciated. The noble poem is nobly decked out in every respect.”</p>

<p><i>Manchester Courier.</i>&mdash;“The decorative designs are at once original, harmonious and
beautiful. A work which will be welcomed alike for its high literary value, and for the
high artistic standard to which it attains.”</p>

<p class="pc4 large"><i>HOUSMAN, CLEMENCE.</i></p>

<p class="pch mid">THE UNKNOWN SEA. <span class="reduct">A Romance by Clemence
Housman, Author of “The Were Wolf.” Crown 8vo,
art vellum, gold top. 6s.</span></p>

<div class="reduct">
<p class="p2"><i>Literature.</i>&mdash;“On the conception of Christian the author may be congratulated. He
is ideal without sentimentality, and his sacrifice and death have the poignancy of
reality, symbol though he is of the world’s greatest idea.”</p>

<p><i>Guardian.</i>&mdash;“Decidedly powerful and effective. Its author has certainly a spell by
which, like the ancient mariner, he can force people to listen to and accept his tale.”</p>

<p><i>Pall Mall Gazette.</i>&mdash;“The story is a powerful one, stirring the imagination with
vague suggestions of mystery, and compelling interest throughout. For those who can
appreciate fine writing, moreover, the style itself will prove an added attraction, and
will not only sustain the reputation which Miss Housman has already made, but will
also enhance the lustre of the talented family of which she is a member.”</p>

<p><i>St James’s Gazette.</i>&mdash;“The qualities that commend this book are its fitting impression
of the supernatural, its studied and generally successful use of words, and its
appreciation of the beauty of visible things. It achieves an absolute effect of beauty,
an effect of a kind extremely rare in English that is not verse. The book has beauty
and sense&mdash;not, thank Heaven, common sense!&mdash;in it, and is quite remote from the
common trash of the book market.”</p>

<p><i>Nottingham Daily Guardian.</i>&mdash;“‘The Unknown Sea’ is not a popular novel; there
is too much really fine work in it for that, but hardly a page fails to indicate the
author’s delicate methods and robust individuality.”</p>
</div>

<p class="pc4 large"><i>SINJOHN, JOHN.</i></p>

<p class="pch mid">JOCELYN. <span class="reduct">A Monte Carlo Story by John Sinjohn,
Author of “From the Four Winds.” Crown 8vo, art

<div class="reduct">
<p class="p2"><i>Daily Mail.</i>&mdash;“The love, as love, is shown with such intensity that it sets the
reader’s heart athrob, and the Riviera setting is aglow with colour and life.”</p>

<p><i>Outlook.</i>&mdash;“He has set it against a charmingly painted background of warm
Southern atmosphere and Mediterranean scenery, and he has drawn, in the persons of
the delightfully commonplace Mrs Travis and Nielson&mdash;the polished cosmopolitan and
professional gambler, with an unsuspected strain of tenderness beneath his impassive
exterior&mdash;two of the best comedy characters that we have encountered in recent fiction.”</p>

<p><i>Manchester Courier.</i>&mdash;“A powerfully written story. The analysis of character is
good, and the depiction of life in the Riviera is excellent.”</p>

<p class="pc4 large"><i>BURROW, C. K.</i></p>

<p class="pch mid">THE FIRE OF LIFE. <span class="reduct">A Novel by C. K. Burrow,
Author of “Asteck’s Madonna,” “The Way of the
Wind,” etc. Crown 8vo, cloth. 6s.</span></p>

<div class="reduct">
<p><i>St James’s Gazette.</i>&mdash;“A clever story. The smoothly-written little tale with its rather
ambitious title is a real pleasure to read, because it has a wholesome, manly tone about
it, and the characters do not appear to be bookmade but of real flesh and blood.”</p>

<p><i>Saturday Review.</i>&mdash;“A good, careful, full-blooded novel of a kind that is not common
nowadays.”</p>

<p><i>Outlook.</i>&mdash;“It has a point of view, a delicate sensitiveness, artistic restraint, subtlety
of perception, and a true literary style. Mr Burrow proves himself an artist with many
sides to his perception.”</p>

<p><i>Literary World.</i>&mdash;“Had we passed it by unread ours would have been the loss. A
charming story based on somewhat conventional lines, but told with such verve and
freshness as render it really welcome. Mr Burrow has admirably succeeded in writing
a really interesting story, and, which is more uncommon, he has well individualised the
different persons of his drama. ‘The Fire of Life’ should figure in the list of novels to
be read of all those who like a good story, and like that good story well told.”</p>

<p><i>Manchester Courier.</i>&mdash;“The whole book is full of ‘fire,’ full of ‘life,’ and full of
interest.”</p>

<p><i>Nottingham Express.</i>&mdash;“The author’s style is clear and crisp, with a purity of
diction it would be difficult to surpass.”</p>
</div>


<p class="pc4 large"><i>PHILIPS, F. C.</i></p>

<p class="pch mid">MEN, WOMEN AND THINGS, <span class="reduct">by F. C. Philips.
Author of “As in a Looking-Glass,” etc. Crown 8vo,
buckram cloth. 3s. 6d.</span></p>

<div class="reduct">
<p><i>Daily Mail.</i>&mdash;“There is hardly one of them which is not enjoyable. Mr Philips’s
manner is suggestive of the manner of Gyp. He is a capital chronicler of the surface
things of life.”</p>

<p><i>Manchester Courier.</i>&mdash;“The author has deservedly secured favour as a writer of
smart stories. In the present volume of short sketches we have the usual vivid delineation
of character, clever dialogue, and at times good use of incident. The volume is
decidedly entertaining.”</p>

<p><i>Country Life.</i>&mdash;“Everything that is written by the author of ‘As in a Looking-Glass’
is clever. There is ingenuity as well as pathos in these stories.”</p>
